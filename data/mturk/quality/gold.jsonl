of fraud in contemporary research are: Gregor Mendel\u2019s \r         data on characteristics of garden peas (where the data, as analyzed by \r         the eminent statistician Sir Ronald Fisher, were found to fit Mendel\u2019s \r         hypotheses too well, such that the data must have been altered or selectively \r         manipulated to conform to Mendel\u2019s expectations); Sir Cyril Burt\u2019s \r         data on IQ\u2019s of identical twins reared apart and reared together \r         (where in three successive studies of such twins with increasing numbers \r         of twin pairs, the correlation coefficients were identical to three decimal \r         points - a virtual statistical impossibility); and the whistle-blowing \r         of Dr. John Darsee\u2019s peers at Harvard Medical School (where his \r         colleagues caught him red-handed falsifying data in a laboratory experiment \r         which led to an investigation that revealed virtually Darsee\u2019s entire \r         research career had been based on data falsification).", "In recent years, several cases of fraud in clinical research have attracted \r         the interest of the lay press.", "In

for meeting and/or surpassing recruitment goals in trials.", "The more subjects recruited, the higher the monetary gains and the investigator\u2019s prestige among his peers.", "Compensate for laziness, sloppiness in data collection.", "Investigators and their staff are loathe to report that they had forgotten to obtain a particular observation or to have not pursued the subject\u2019s delinquency in making a clinic visit and will, therefore, fabricate such data.", "Include subjects who would otherwise be excluded.", "Sometimes the inclusion of patients who should be excluded from the trial can have a noble motive.", "A clinical investigator may feel that it is in his/her patient\u2019s best interest in regard to medical care to be included in a trial, rather than to exclude that patient because of an exclusion criterion in the protocol that the investigator knows has little or no clinical meaning for the patient\u2019s prognosis.", "Three Frequent Fraudulent Practices in Clinical Trials Fabricating missing measurements.", "Investigators may compensate for missing data due to a missed visit.", "One manipulation is to interpolate the data from the previous visit and the subsequent visit, or to use the data from the previous visit; i.e.", "last observation carried forward.", "These are legitimate methods for handling missing data if the data analyst who uses them reports them as such.", "It is not legitimate if an investigator does the seemingly identical thing and the interpolated or carried forward data are allowed to appear as actual data.", "These are then

into earth\u2019s orbit, Musk wanted to send them\u00a0to Mars.", "\u201cHe asked if I thought that was crazy,\u201d Zachary said.", "\u201cI asked, \u2018Do the mice come back?", "Because, if they don\u2019t, yeah, most people will think that\u2019s crazy.\u2019\u2009\u201d Musk said that the mice were not only meant to go to Mars and come back but they also would come home with the baby mice, too.", "Musk built a network of space experts and brought the best of them together at a series of salons\u2014sometimes at the Renaissance hotel at the Los Angeles airport and sometimes at the Sheraton in Palo Alto.", "Musk had no formal business plan.", "He mostly wanted them to help him develop the mice-to-Mars idea or at least to come up with something comparable.", "Musk hoped to hit on a wondrous gesture for mankind\u2014some type of event that would capture the world\u2019s attention, get people thinking about Mars again, and have them reflect on man\u2019s potential.", "Scientists showed up from NASA\u2019s JPL.", "Cameron was there again, along with Griffin.", "No one on the planet knew more about the realities of getting things into space than Griffin, and he was consulting for Musk.", "Four years later, he would be running NASA.", "The experts were thrilled to have another rich guy appear who was willing to fund something interesting in space.", "They happily debated the merits and feasibility of sending up the mice.", "But the discussion turned to a different project, the \u201cMars Oasis.\u201d In this scenario, Musk would buy a rocket and use it to shoot what amounted to a robotic greenhouse to Mars, a space-ready growth chamber for plants that could open up briefly and scoop in some of the Martian regolith, or soil, and then use it to grow a plant, which would in turn produce the first oxygen on Mars.", "Much to Musk\u2019s liking, this plan seemed both ostentatious and feasible.", "Musk wanted the space greenhouse to have a way to send a video feed to earth, so people could watch the plant grow.", "The group also talked about mailing kits to students around the country who would nurture their own plants simultaneously and notice, for example, that the Martian plant could grow twice as high as its earthbound counterpart in the same amount of time.", "Musk\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea started to inspire the group, many of whom had grown cynical about anything novel happening in space again.", "There were immense engineering challenges that would need solving.", "Getting Martian soil into the structure seemed not only hard to do physically but also problematic because the regolith would be toxic.", "For a while, the scientists debated growing the plant in a nutrient-rich gel instead, but that felt like cheating.", "Even the optimistic moments were awash in unknowns.", "One scientist found some very resilient mustard seeds and thought they could possibly survive a treated version of the Martian soil.", "\u201cThere was a pretty big downside if the plant didn\u2019t survive,\u201d said Dave Bearden, a space industry veteran who attended the meetings.", "\u201cYou\u2019d have this dead garden on Mars.\u201d The main thing troubling the space experts was Musk\u2019s budget.", "Following the salons, it seemed like Musk wanted to spend somewhere between $20 million and $30 million on the stunt, and everyone knew that the cost of a rocket launch alone would eat up that money and then some.", "Musk, however, had his own plans.", "He\u2019d been devouring books he\u2019d borrowed from Cantrell and others.", "They included Rocket Propulsion Elements, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, and Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion.", "According to Musk\u2019s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-size rocket that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space.", "In June 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX.", "He was on his way to Mars.", "SpaceX\u2019s first headquarters was in an old warehouse at 1310 East Grand Ave. in El Segundo, a suburb of Los Angeles.", "It had 75,000 square feet of open space and several receiving bays, allowing Musk to drive his silver McLaren F1 sports car right into his office.", "It was a sparse, hangarlike building with a dusty floor and curved ceilings.", "During the first week of SpaceX\u2019s operations, delivery trucks showed up with laptops and printers and folding tables.", "Musk walked over to one of the loading docks, rolled up the door, and offloaded the equipment himself.", "Desks were eventually interspersed around the factory so the computer scientists and engineers designing the machines could sit with the welders and machinists building the hardware.", "In aerospace, this was daring.", "Traditional aerospace companies separate engineers and machinists by thousands of miles.", "SpaceX planned to do a lot of things differently.", "Instead of assembling parts from thousands of suppliers, the company would build as much machinery as it could in-house.", "This included things like a mobile launchpad and\u2014most ambitiously\u2014rocket engines.", "Wherever possible, SpaceX would be faster, cheaper, and better than its competitors.", "It would launch multiple rockets each month, make money off each one, and never need to become a huge contractor dependent on government funds.", "SpaceX\u2019s first rocket would be called the Falcon\u00a01, a nod to Star Wars\u2019 Millennium Falcon.", "At a time when the cost of sending a 550-pound payload into orbit started at $30 million, Musk promised that the Falcon 1 would be able to carry a 1,400-pound payload for $6.9 million.", "The proposed timeline for upending the aerospace industry was comically short.", "One of the earliest SpaceX presentations promised the first complete engine by May\u00a02003, a second engine in June, the body of the rocket in July, and everything assembled by August.", "A launchpad would be ready by September, and the first launch would take place in November 2003, or about 15 months after the company started.", "A trip to Mars was naturally slated for somewhere near the end of the decade.", "\u201cElon has always been optimistic,\u201d said Kevin Brogan, an early SpaceX recruit.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the nice word.", "He can be a downright liar about when things need to get done.", "He will pick the most aggressive time schedule imaginable assuming everything goes right, and then accelerate it by assuming that everyone can work harder.\u201d Musk sought out young overachievers, personally calling top students in aerospace programs and recruiting them over the phone.", "\u201cI thought it was a prank call,\u201d said Michael Colonno, who heard from Musk while attending Stanford.", "\u201cI did not believe for a minute that he had a rocket company.\u201d Once the students looked Musk up on the Internet, selling them on SpaceX was easy.", "As word of SpaceX\u2019s ambitions spread, top engineers with a high tolerance for risk from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital Sciences fled to the upstart, too.", "Throughout the first year at SpaceX, one or two new employees joined almost every week.", "Brogan was employee No.", "23 and came from TRW, a soon-to-be-shuttered aerospace player, where he\u2019d been used to various internal policies blocking him from doing work.", "\u201cI called it the country club,\u201d he said.", "\u201cNobody did anything.\u201d Brogan started at SpaceX the day after his interview and was told to scrounge around the office and find a computer to use.", "\u201cIt was go to Fry\u2019s and get whatever you need and go to Staples and get a chair,\u201d Brogan said.", "One of the first projects was the construction of a gas generator, a machine not unlike a small rocket engine that produces hot gas to power pumps.", "Tom Mueller, another TRW veteran, Tim Buzza, a defector from Boeing, and a couple of young engineers assembled the generator in Los Angeles and then packed it into the back of a pickup truck and drove it out to Mojave to test it.", "A desert town about 100 miles from Los Angeles, Mojave had become a hub for aerospace companies such as Scaled Composites and XCOR.", "The SpaceX team borrowed a test stand from XCOR that was just about the perfect size to hold the gas generator.", "The first ignition run took place at 11 a.m. and lasted 90 seconds.", "The generator worked, but it let out a billowing black cloud that settled right over the airport tower.", "In the days that followed, SpaceX\u2019s engineers perfected a routine that let them do multiple tests a day\u2014an unheard-of practice at the airport\u2014and had the gas generator tuned to their liking after two weeks of work.", "The SpaceX team made a few more trips to Mojave and some other spots, including a test stand at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California and another in Mississippi.", "While on this countrywide rocketry tour, the SpaceX engineers visited a 300-acre test site in McGregor, Texas, a small city near the center of the state.", "The site was a leftover from another billionaire, Andrew Beal, a real estate and finance whiz in Texas, who had folded his aerospace startup after pouring millions into the massive test facility.", "The SpaceX engineers really liked this spot\u2014and the three-story concrete test stand Beal had left there\u2014and talked Musk into buying it.", "Jeremy Hollman, a young engineer, soon found himself living in Texas.", "Hollman exemplified the kind of recruit Musk wanted: He\u2019d earned an aerospace engineering degree from Iowa State University and a master\u2019s in astronautical engineering from the University of Southern California.", "He\u2019d spent a couple of years working as a test engineer at Boeing dealing with jets, rockets, and spacecraft.", "At 23, Hollman was young, single, and willing to give up any semblance of having a life in favor of working at SpaceX nonstop, and he became Mueller\u2019s second in command.", "Mueller had developed a pair of 3D computer models of the two engines he wanted to build.", "Merlin would be the engine for the first stage of the Falcon\u00a01, which lifted it off the ground, and Kestrel would be the smaller engine used to power the upper, second stage of the rocket and guide it in space.", "Together, Hollman and Mueller figured out which parts SpaceX would build at the Los Angeles factory and which parts it would try to buy.", "For the purchased parts, Hollman had to head to various machine shops and get quotes and delivery dates for the hardware.", "Quite often, the machinists told Hollman that SpaceX\u2019s timelines were nuts.", "Others were more accommodating and would try to bend an existing product to SpaceX\u2019s needs instead of building something from scratch.", "Hollman also found that ingenuity got him a long way.", "He discovered, for example, that changing the seals on some readily available carwash valves made them good enough to be used with rocket fuel.", "In addition to building its own engines, rocket bodies, and capsules, SpaceX designed its own motherboards and circuits, sensors to detect vibrations, flight computers, and solar panels.", "On a radio, SpaceX\u2019s engineers found that they could reduce the weight of the device by about 20 percent.", "And the cost savings were dramatic, dropping from the $50,000 to $100,000 for the industrial-grade equipment used by aerospace companies to $5,000 for\u00a0SpaceX\u2019s unit.", "Even as they were trying to figure out Falcon 1, Musk was planning to build something he was calling the BFR, aka the Big Falcon Rocket or Big F---ing Rocket.", "It would have the biggest rocket engine in history.", "Musk\u2019s bigger, faster mentality amused and impressed some of the suppliers that SpaceX occasionally turned to for help, like Barber-Nichols, a Colorado-based maker of rocket engine turbo pumps and other aerospace machinery.", "Bob Linden, a Barber-Nichols executive, remembers dealing with him.", "\u201cElon showed up with Tom Mueller and started telling us it was his destiny to launch things into space at lower costs and to help us become spacefaring people,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWe thought the world of Tom but weren\u2019t quite sure whether to take Elon too seriously.", "They began asking us for the impossible.", "They wanted a turbo pump to be built in less than a year for under $1\u00a0million.", "Boeing might do a project like that over five years for $100\u00a0million.", "Tom told us to give it our best shot, and we built it in 13\u00a0months.", "He was relentless.\u201d After SpaceX completed its first engine at the factory in California, Hollman loaded it along with mounds of other equipment into a U-Haul trailer, hitched it to the back of a white Hummer H2, and drove it down Interstate\u00a010 from Los Angeles to the test site in Texas.", "Amid rattlesnakes, fire ants, isolation, and searing heat, the group fastened their prototype engine to the stand, filled it with liquid oxygen and kerosene, hid in a bunker behind a dirt berm, and fired it, for all of 0.1 seconds.", "The bad news was it would need a lot of work.", "The good news was it didn\u2019t blow up.", "(That would happen later, and the engineers had a term for that, a \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly.\u201d) After that first successful burn, the employees christened the site by drinking a $1,200 bottle of R\u00e9my Martin, left over from SpaceX\u2019s inaugural party, out of paper cups.", "Over the next years, the trek from California to the test site became known as the Texas Cattle Haul.", "SpaceX engineers would work for 10 days straight in Texas, come back to California for a weekend, and then head back.", "To ease the burden of travel, Musk sometimes let them use his private jet.", "\u201cIt carried six people,\u201d Mueller said.", "\u201cWell, seven if someone sat in the toilet, which happened all the time.\u201d Musk, of course, wasn\u2019t just building rockets.", "In 2003, about a year after he started SpaceX, Musk helped found Tesla Motors, which planned to sell an electric sports car.", "Musk had spent years pining after a good electric car, and though he had committed $100 million to SpaceX, he would now put an additional $70 million into Tesla and end up as the company\u2019s CEO.", "It was a decision that would almost break both companies.", "As he prepared to begin filming Iron Man in early 2007, director Jon Favreau rented out a complex in Los Angeles that once belonged to Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace and defense contractor started about 80 years earlier by Howard Hughes.", "The facility had a series of interlocking hangars and served as a production office for the movie.", "It also supplied Robert Downey Jr., who was to play Iron Man and his human creator, Tony Stark, with a splash of inspiration.", "Downey felt nostalgic looking at one of the larger hangars, which had fallen into a state of disrepair.", "Not too long ago, that building had played host to the big ideas of a big man who shook up industries and did things his own way.", "Downey had heard about a Howard Hughes-like figure who had constructed his own industrial complex about 10\u00a0miles from the Iron Man set.", "Instead of visualizing how life might have been for Hughes, Downey could perhaps get a taste of the real thing.", "In March 2007, he visited SpaceX\u2019s headquarters in El Segundo and wound up receiving a personal tour from Musk.", "\u201cMy mind is not easily blown, but this place and this guy were amazing,\u201d Downey said.", "To Downey, the SpaceX facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware store.", "Enthusiastic employees were zipping about, fiddling with an assortment of machines.", "Young white-collar engineers interacted with blue-collar assembly line workers, and they all seemed to share a genuine excitement for what they were doing.", "\u201cIt felt like a radical startup company,\u201d Downey said.", "After the initial tour, Downey came away pleased that the sets being hammered out at the former Hughes factory did have parallels to the SpaceX operations.", "\u201cThings didn\u2019t feel out of place,\u201d he said.", "The men walked, sat in Musk\u2019s office, and had lunch.", "Downey appreciated that Musk was not a foul-smelling, fidgety, coder whack job.", "What Downey picked up on instead were Musk\u2019s \u201caccessible eccentricities\u201d and the feeling that he was someone who could work alongside the people in the factory.", "When he returned to the Iron Man production office, Downey asked that Favreau be sure to place a Tesla Roadster in Tony Stark\u2019s workshop.", "\u201cAfter meeting Elon and making him real to me, I felt like having his presence in the workshop,\u201d Downey said.", "\u201cThey became contemporaries.", "Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\u201d Musk later had a cameo in Iron Man 2.", "Musk enjoyed his rising profile.", "He and Justine bought a house in Bel Air.", "Their neighbors were Quincy Jones, and Joe Francis, the creator of the Girls Gone Wild videos.", "Musk and some former PayPal executives produced Thank You for Smoking and used Musk\u2019s jet in the movie.", "While not a carouser, Musk took part in the Hollywood nightlife and its social scene.", "\u201cWe had a domestic staff of five; during the day our home transformed into a workplace,\u201d Justine wrote in a magazine article for Marie Claire.", "\u201cWe went to black-tie fundraisers and got the best tables at elite Hollywood nightclubs, with Paris Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio partying next to us.", "When Google co-founder Larry Page got married on Richard Branson\u2019s private Caribbean island, we were there, hanging out in a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono pose with swarms of adoring women outside the reception tent.\u201d By this time, SpaceX was looking like a real aerospace company.", "It had built and tested its engines and completed a full rocket body.", "All Musk needed now was to fire the thing into the sky and see what happened.", "Under normal circumstances, SpaceX might have launched its rockets from the nearby Vandenberg Air Force Base.", "The site has several launchpads to pick from, but none of the current tenants\u2014Boeing, Lockheed, and the Air Force\u2014were all that interested in helping an Internet executive get to space.", "Locked out locally, SpaceX decided to try Kwajalein Island\u2014or Kwaj\u2014the largest island in an atoll between Guam and Hawaii and part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.", "The U. S. Army had used it for decades as a missile test site.", "Gwynne Shotwell, then SpaceX\u2019s vice president for business development, looked up the name of a colonel at the test site and sent him an e-mail.", "Three weeks later she got a call back from the Army saying they would love to have SpaceX fly from the islands.", "To get to Kwaj, the SpaceX employees either flew on Musk\u2019s jet or took commercial flights through Hawaii.", "The main accommodations were two-bedroom affairs that looked more like dormitories than hotel rooms, with their military-issued dressers and desks.", "Over the course of several months a small team of people cleared brush on nearby Omelek Island to create a launch site and converted a double-wide trailer into offices.", "The work took place in soul-sapping humidity under a sun powerful enough to burn the skin through a T-shirt.", "The SpaceX team started at sunrise, around 7 a.m., and went until 7\u00a0p.m. \u201cOne or two people would decide it was their night to cook, and they would make steak and potatoes and pasta,\u201d Hollman said.", "\u201cWe had a bunch of movies and a DVD player, and some of us did a lot of fishing off the docks.\u201d For many of the engineers, this was both a torturous and magical experience.", "\u201cAt Boeing you could be comfortable, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen at SpaceX,\u201d said Walter Sims, a SpaceX tech expert who found time to get certified to scuba dive while on Kwaj.", "\u201cEvery person on that island was a f---ing star, and they were always holding seminars on radios or the engine.", "It was such an invigorating place.\u201d Time and again, the rocket would get rolled out to the launchpad and tipped vertical for a couple of days, and then technical and safety checks would reveal a host of new problems.", "As soon as they could, the engineers returned it to the hangar to protect it from the salty air.", "Teams that had labored separately for months back at the SpaceX factory\u2014propulsion, avionics, software\u2014were thrown together on the island and forced to become an interdisciplinary whole.", "\u201cIt was like Gilligan\u2019s Island except with rockets,\u201d Hollman said.", "Finally, on March 24, 2006, the engineers had fixed enough bugs to launch.", "The Falcon 1 stood on its square launchpad and ignited.", "It soared into the sky and started to shrink against the vast blue expanse.", "In the island control room, Musk paced as he watched the action, wearing shorts, flip-flops, and a T-shirt.", "Then, about 25\u00a0seconds in, a fire broke out above the Merlin engine, and suddenly this machine that had been flying straight and true started to spin and then tumble back to earth.", "The Falcon 1 ended up falling directly onto the launch site.", "Most of the debris went into a reef 250 feet from the launchpad, and the satellite cargo smashed through SpaceX\u2019s machine shop roof and landed more or less intact on the floor.", "Some of the engineers put on their snorkeling and scuba gear and recovered the pieces, fitting all of the rocket\u2019s remnants into two refrigerator-size crates.", "After the crash, there was a lot of drinking at a bar on the main island.", "Musk wanted to launch again within six months, but putting together a new machine would require an immense amount of work.", "Musk had vowed publicly that he would build a working rocket, but people inside and outside the company were doing back-of-the-envelope math and could tell that SpaceX likely could afford only one more attempt.", "To the extent that the financial situation unnerved Musk, he rarely if ever let it show to employees.", "\u201cElon did a great job of not burdening people with those worries,\u201d said Branden Spikes, head of IT for SpaceX.", "\u201cHe always communicated the importance of being lean and of success, but it was never, \u2018If we fail, we\u2019re done for.\u2019 He was very optimistic.\u201d Meanwhile, SpaceX had put another group of engineers on a new project to develop the Falcon 9, a nine-engine rocket that would serve as a possible replacement for the retiring space shuttle.", "SpaceX had yet to prove it could get to space successfully, but Musk was already positioning the company to bid on big-ticket NASA contracts.", "In mid-2008, SpaceX prepared its fourth rocket for launch.", "Typically, the body of the Falcon 1 traveled to Kwaj via barge.", "Maybe it was \u201cgo fever,\u201d which is how rocket people describe the manic decision-making that can characterize a launch, but this time around Musk and the engineers were too excited and desperate to wait for the ocean journey.", "Musk rented a military cargo plane to fly the rocket body from Los Angeles to Hawaii and then on to Kwaj.", "This would have been a fine idea except the SpaceX engineers forgot to think about what the pressurized plane would do to the body of the rocket, which is less than an eighth of an inch thick.", "As the plane started its descent into Hawaii, strange noises came from the cargo hold.", "\u201cI looked back and could see the stage crumpling,\u201d said Bulent Altan, the former head of avionics at SpaceX.", "\u201cI told the pilot to go up, and he did.\u201d The rocket was buckling from the increasing air pressure like an empty water bottle.", "Altan saw that the SpaceX team on the plane had about 30 minutes to do something about the problem before they would need to land.", "They pulled out their pocketknives and cut away the shrink wrap that covered the rocket.", "They found a maintenance kit on the plane and used the wrenches to open up some nuts on the rocket that would allow its internal pressure to match that of the plane\u2019s.", "When the plane landed, the engineers divvied up the duties of calling SpaceX\u2019s top executives to tell them what happened.", "It was 3 a.m. Los Angeles time, and one of the executives volunteered to deliver the news to Musk.", "It looked like three months of work to fix the rocket.", "The body had caved in several places, and the baffles placed inside the fuel tank to stop the fuel from sloshing had broken.", "Musk ordered the team to continue on to Kwaj and sent in a reinforcement team with repair parts.", "Two weeks later, the rocket was fixed.", "\u201cIt was like being stuck in a foxhole together,\u201d Altan said.", "\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to quit and leave the person next to you behind.\u201d The fourth and possibly final launch for SpaceX took place on Sept. 28, 2008.", "SpaceX employees had worked nonstop shifts for months to reach this moment.", "They had been separated from their families, in exile on their tiny, hot outpost\u2014sometimes without much food\u2014for days on end as they waited for launch windows to open and dealt with the aborts that followed.", "In the late afternoon, the SpaceX team raised the Falcon 1 to its launch position.", "It stood tall, looking like a bizarre artifact from the future as palm trees swayed beside it and a smattering of clouds crossed through the spectacular blue sky.", "By this time, SpaceX had turned each launch into a major Web production, so there was a worldwide audience.", "The Falcon 1 was not carrying real cargo this time; neither the company nor the military nor NASA wanted to see something else blow up or get lost at sea, so the rocket held a 360-pound dummy payload.", "Musk, back in Los Angeles, tried to distract himself from the mounting pressure by going to Disneyland with his brother Kimbal and their children, but by 4 p.m. he was back in SpaceX\u2019s L. A. control room, watching the feed.", "As the rocket rumbled and then climbed higher, the employees inside SpaceX\u2019s headquarters let out raucous cheers.", "Each milestone that followed\u2014clearing the island, engine checks coming back good\u2014was again met with whistles and shouts.", "After the first stage fell away, the second stage fired up about 90 seconds into the flight and the employees turned downright rapturous, filling the webcast with their ecstatic hollering.", "\u201cPerfect,\u201d said one of the talking heads.", "The Kestrel engine glowed red and started its six-minute burn.", "\u201cWhen the second stage cleared, I could finally start breathing again and my knees stopped buckling,\u201d said James McLaury, a machinist at\u00a0SpaceX.", "The fairing opened up around the three-minute mark and fell back toward earth.", "And, finally, around nine minutes into its journey, the Falcon 1 shut down just as planned.", "After six years\u2014about four-and-a-half more than Musk had once planned\u2014the first privately built, liquid-fueled rocket had reached orbit.", "\u201cEveryone burst into tears,\u201d Kimbal said.", "\u201cIt was one of the most emotional experiences I\u2019ve had.\u201d Musk left the control room and walked out to the factory floor, where he received a rock star\u2019s welcome.", "\u201cWell, that was freaking awesome,\u201d he said.", "\u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018The fourth time is the charm,\u2019 right?\u201d The afterglow, however, soon faded.", "SpaceX, like Musk\u2019s other company, Tesla, was facing a major cash shortage.", "SpaceX had the Falcon 9 efforts to support and had also greenlighted the construction of the Dragon capsule, which would take supplies and, one day, humans, to the International Space Station.", "Historically, either project would have cost more than $1 billion to complete, but SpaceX would have to find a way to build both machines simultaneously for a fraction of the cost.", "The company had dramatically increased the rate at which it hired employees and moved into a much larger headquarters.", "SpaceX had a commercial flight booked to carry a satellite into orbit for the Malaysian government, but that launch and the payment for it would not arrive until the middle of 2009.", "In the meantime, SpaceX simply struggled to make its payroll.", "Just when it figured out how to fly a rocket, SpaceX was going broke.", "As bad as they were, the financial problems did not compare to the collapse of Musk\u2019s personal life.", "Not long after moving to Los Angeles, Musk had lost his 10-week-old son, Nevada Alexander, to sudden infant death syndrome.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019d want to talk about extremely sad events,\u201d Musk told me.", "\u201cIt does no good for the future.", "If you\u2019ve got other kids and obligations, then wallowing in sadness does no good for anyone around you.", "I\u2019m not sure what should be done in such situations.\u201d Musk went on to have five more sons with Justine\u2014twins and triplets\u2014but their relationship broke apart in 2008, and Musk filed for divorce.", "Justine soon began documenting the divorce on a blog, and the press was all too happy to merge the personal details into stories of Musk\u2019s financial woes.", "Reporters seemed to take a special pleasure in attacking Tesla.", "The electric car maker had suffered through numerous product delays, management changes, and cost overruns.", "After five years and tens of millions of dollars, there was still no Tesla available to buy.", "A website called the Truth About Cars began a \u201cTesla Death Watch\u201d in May 2008 and followed up with dozens of entries throughout the year.", "The blog captured Tesla\u2019s engineering issues and Musk\u2019s feud with Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard, who\u2019d been forced out of the company.", "\u201cI was just getting pistol-whipped,\u201d Musk said.", "\u201cThere was a lot of schadenfreude at the time, and it was bad on so many levels.", "Justine was torturing me in the press.", "...", "It hurt really bad.", "You have these huge doubts that your life is not working, your car is not working, you\u2019re going through a divorce and all of those things.", "I felt like a pile of s---.", "I didn\u2019t think we would overcome it.", "I thought things were probably f---ing doomed.\u201d When Musk looked at the numbers, it looked like only one company would survive.", "\u201cI could either pick SpaceX or Tesla or split the money I had left between them,\u201d Musk said.", "\u201cThat was a tough decision.", "If I split the money, maybe both of them would die.", "If I gave the money to just one company, the probability of it surviving

prospect for a young, determined black actor like himself\u2014but what he didn\u2019t know was that his transatlantic crossing would prove just as important as his decision to emigrate.", "To cover the costs of his travel, Aldridge worked as a steward aboard the ship that took him to Britain, but during the journey he made the acquaintance of British actor and producer James Wallack.", "The pair had met months earlier in New York, and when they happened to meet again en route to Europe, Wallack offered Aldridge the opportunity to become his personal attendant.", "On their arrival in

physical representations of bodily anguish we ever witnessed.\"", "Astonishingly, Aldridge was still just 17 years old.", "From his London debut at the Royalty, Aldridge slowly worked his way up the city\u2019s playbill, playing ever-more-upmarket theaters across London.", "His Othello transferred to the Royal Coburg Theatre later in 1825.", "A lead role in a stage adaptation of Aphra Behn\u2019s Oroonoko followed, as did an acclaimed supporting turn in Titus Andronicus.", "To prove his versatility, he took on a well-received comedic role as a bumbling butler in an 18th-century comedy, The Padlock.", "Aldridge\u2019s reputation grew steadily, and before long he was receiving top billing as the \u201cAfrican Roscius\u201d (a reference to the famed Ancient Roman actor Quintus Roscius Gallus) or the renowned \u201cAfrican Tragedian\u201d\u2014the first African-American actor to establish himself outside of America.", "Even in the more-accepting society of abolitionist Britain, however, Aldridge still had mountains to climb.", "When his portrayal of Othello later moved to Covent Garden in 1833, some reviewers thought a black actor treading the boards on one of London\u2019s most hallowed stages was simply a step too far.", "The critics soured, their reviews became more scathing\u2014and the racism behind them became ever more apparent.", "Campaigns were launched to have Aldridge removed from the London stage, with the local Figaro newspaper among his vilest opponents.", "Shortly after his Covent Garden debut, the paper openly campaigned to cause \u201csuch a

peculiarly qualified.\u201d Fortunately, they weren\u2019t successful\u2014but the affair temporarily ruined the London stage for Aldridge.", "Instead of accepting defeat, Aldridge took both Othello and The Padlock on a tour of Britain\u2019s provincial theaters.", "The move proved to be an immense success.", "During his national tour, Aldridge amassed a great many new fans, and even became manager of the Coventry Theatre in 1828, making him the first black manager of a British theater.", "He also earned a name for himself by passing the time between performances lecturing on the evils of slavery, and lending his increasingly weighty support to the abolitionist movement.", "Next, he took his tour to Ireland, and on his arrival in Dublin became a near-instant star.", "With the island still locked in a tense relationship with Britain at the time, he was welcomed with open arms when Irish theatergoers heard how badly he had been treated in London.", "(In one flattering address in Dublin, Aldridge told the audience: \u201cHere the sable African was free / From every bond, save those which kindness threw / Around his heart, and bound it fast to you.\u201d) By the 1830s, Aldridge was touring Britain and Ireland with a one-man show of his own design, mixing impeccable dramatic monologues and Shakespearean recitals with songs, tales from his life, and lectures on abolitionism.", "As an antidote to the blackface minstrel shows that were popular at the time, he also began donning \u201cwhiteface\u201d to portray roles as diverse as Shylock, Macbeth, Richard III, and King Lear.", "When the notorious Thomas Rice arrived in England with his racist \u201cJump Jim Crow\u201d minstrel routine, Aldridge skillfully and bravely weaved one of Rice\u2019s own skits into his show: By parodying the parody, he robbed Rice\u2019s performance of its crass impact\u2014while simultaneously showing himself to be an expert performer in the process.", "Such was his popularity that Aldridge could easily have seen out his days in England, playing to packed theaters every night for the rest of career.", "But by the 1850s, word of his skill as an actor had spread far.", "Never one to shy away from a challenge, in 1852 he assembled a troupe of actors and headed out on a tour of the continent.", "Within a matter of months, Aldridge had become perhaps the most lauded actor in all Europe.", "Critics raved about his performances, with one German writer even suggesting that he may well be \u201cthe greatest of all actors.\u201d A Polish reviewer noted, \"Though the majority of spectators did not speak English, they did, however, understand the feelings portrayed on the artist's face, eyes, lips, in the tones of his voice, in the entire body.\"", "Celebrity fans were quick

followed, with Friedrich-Wilhelm IV, the King of Prussia, awarding Aldridge the Prussian Gold Medal for Art and Science.", "In Saxe-Meiningen (now a part of Germany), he was given the title of Chevalier Baron of Saxony in 1858.", "Aldridge continued his European tours for another decade, using the money he earned to buy two properties in London (including one, suitably enough, on Hamlet Road).", "But by then, the Civil War was over and America beckoned.", "Now in his late fifties\u2014but no less eager for a challenge\u2014Aldridge planned one last venture: a 100-date tour of the

one can find the permanent exhibit \u2013 a history of homosexuality from the dawn of man to present day.", "The museum\u2019s goal is to illustrate the continual plight of the homosexual community and the tenacious efforts of gay men to recognize and cultivate their identities.", "But there are few, if any, women depicted.", "Towards the end of the permanent exhibit there are several captions that mention the lesbian community, but for the most part the female involvement with the homosexual movement is largely overlooked.", "Founded in 1985, the museum originally was constructed as a half-male, half-female exhibition.", "There were hopes of creating a long-standing museum but at that point, the founders were not certain of anything.", "As the exhibition gradually evolved into the Schwules Museum, the female presence in the art and history ebbed away.", "The lesbian history and data was eventually transferred to the Spinnboden Archive \u2013 a more textual museum that men can only visit by appointment.", "Today the Schwules Museum\u2019s board of directors and a strong majority of the staff are male.", "Karl-Heinz Steinle, one of the Schwules Museum\u2019s curators and J\u00f6rg Leidig, who heads the photo art exhibition, both acknowledge the lack of Lesbian representation in the museum but emphasize the fact that \u201cschwul\u201d, literally translated, means gay male.", "Steinle emphasizes that they understand the one-sidedness of the museum, \u201cOh we definitely get negative feedback from most women that visit the museum.", "They all agree that lesbians aren\u2019t depicted in the museum, and well, that is the truth.", "It\u2019s a gay male museum.\u201d Leidig further defends their current approach, \u201cWe would one hundred percent support a lesbian museum but they have the Spinnboden Archive already.", "We also have plans to incorporate some temporary lesbian exhibitions in the coming years.\u201d Steinle and Leidig mentioned that some schools and groups come to the museum on tours.", "Considering the long history of homosexuality and the importance of its universal acceptance, it is important that the community continues to be educated on human rights issues.", "But one would expect that most of those groups will not go on to visit the lesbian archives in pursuit of a further understanding of homosexuality\u2019s evolution.", "From this unilateral approach, male homosexuality is seen as an appropriate, welcoming reality while lesbians are once again neglected and conceivably invisible.", "Women in these tour groups that are questioning their own sexuality are not more likely to explore the issue if they see it as primarily a male matter.", "Unfortunately in Germany the Schwules Museum is not the only gay venue that marginalizes the lesbian lifestyle.", "A majority of the planning board for Christopher Street Day (the parade and subsequent celebrations that are practiced annually in remembrance of the Stonewall Inn riots) is comprised of gay males.", "Gay men are visible throughout the political scene, the media and academia.", "There are even celebrations and parades for homosexual rights which are labeled as schwule events instead of queer or homosexual.", "Perhaps the problem is not that lesbians are disregarded but rather, that they are not presenting themselves in the public arena.", "Furthermore, it may be a cyclical dilemma where lesbian women are just further reinforcing others trepidations by not coming out themselves.", "Theories and Ideas, but Nothing Concrete There is a lot of speculation behind why lesbians appear more reluctant to come out than gay males.", "One gay male at Christopher Street Day argued that homosexual men have had to overcome the prejudices to a different degree than lesbians.", "Gay men have traditionally been the targets of ridicule and harassment and thus, they launched a more visible and wide-stretching unification.", "This union battled directly with Paragraph 175 and fought for homosexual rights in other theaters as well.", "It was in this manner that lesbians \u2018band-wagoned\u2019 behind the gay movement.", "They essentially did not need to fight for their acquisition of rights.", "The interviewee also mentioned his belief in the inherent behavior of men as naturally being more boisterous and rowdy than women.", "Leidig and Steinle from the Schwules Museum further added that men were \u201cforced to react\u201d much more than lesbian women were.", "They contended that when men are seen together in a playful way they are frequently regarded as homosexuals, while women in the same scenario \u201ccan just be friends.\u201d \u00a0Men have had to deal with homosexual accusations and attacks more directly than lesbians, therefore, they were \u201cforced to react\u201d in a more unified way.", "This reaction led to a stronger gay community that was not only more visible but more internally supportive as well.", "Most of the females interviewed at Christopher Street Day argued that women have been more reserved in the past, but they have consistently fought step for step with their gay counterparts.", "Constanze K\u00f6rner, a mediator with \u201cLesben und Schwulenverband Deutschland \u2013 Berlin und Brandenburg\u201d (Lesbian and Gay Federation of Germany Berlin/Brandenburg Branch), clarified that gays and

legitimate lesbian identity that need not yield to gay men or heterosexual society.", "She is not afraid to voice her controversial opinions.", "Kay agrees with the mentality that men are more boisterous and rowdy than women.", "However she would see this as a trained behavior and not as a natural occurrence.", "She believes that throughout history women have been conditioned to fill subservient roles to men \u2013 as wives and child-bearers.", "Society has essentially taught women to fulfill the needs of others and hide their sexual feelings.", "Kay also holds that such roles are not women's natural behavior but rather their trained behavior.", "Kay is not just revisiting feminist thought, she is expressing it for a new generation.", "Kay adopts the argument that society has overly institutionalized sex and gender roles.", "Women have been \u2018educated\u2019 to act in a subservient role to men \u2013 where female emotions are shelved for the well-being of the \u2018institutionalized relationship.\u2019 To Ms. Kay, propagating the idea that women exist to have children is not only socially dangerous but also sexist.", "It puts them in a role that they may not want to conform too.", "Partially through L-Mag and partially through her own articulation, Manuela Kay aims to turn off the \u201cheterosexual societal remote control\u201d that is manipulating German society.", "The idea of marriage and children should not be imposed on anyone, she believes.", "To some it is a basic pillar of society, but is not where some hope to direct their life.", "Ms.

something if you don\u2019t necessarily believe in it?\"", "Ms. Kay asks.", "L-Mag is read by lesbians throughout Germany and is considered an influential journal across the European continent for the queer community.", "The publication claims its goal is not to create a lesbian mind frame but to provide an environment where lesbians can comfortably communicate.", "L-Mag has articles, reviews, advertisements and support group hotlines.", "Its success is evident when most lesbians encountered at Christopher Street Day acknowledge that they do in fact read the magazine.", "Manuela Kay's teachings are undeniably having an impact on the lesbian community.", "Ute Hiller acts as a coordinator and councilor for Lesbenberatung Berlin (Lesbian Counseling Berlin).", "Her job supports the lesbian lifestyle by providing a forum for discussion about topics ranging from depression to relationship counseling.", "They have a special center for lesbian minorities \u2013 inclusive of Muslim, black, Arabic, or trans-gender women.", "She estimates that her organization will annually receive approximately 8,000 contacts from women looking for some kind of direction or assistance.", "Hiller definitely adopts a more conservative stance than Kay does.", "While Kay is more concerned with the lesbian identity as a whole, Hiller targets individuals hoping to \u2018come out\u2019 phase by phase.", "\u2018Coming out\u2019 is a very arbitrary measurement \u2013 when is someone completely out: when they have told their family and friends or is more publicity required?", "A lot of Hiller\u2019s work deals with treating the apprehensions that lesbians have about approaching these various phases.", "Anne Stalfort, the director of the Humanity in Action German internship program in Berlin, comments that lesbians have a larger battle to face than gay men.", "Stalfort made a comparison between lesbians and the Asian minority living in Germany.", "Both exist and are active across the country, but they are extremely underrepresented in the media, the corporate world, and the political spectrum.", "As well as dealing with family and social issues, women already experience discrimination in the work environment \u2013 many investigations show that females receive lower wages for doing the same work and do not have as many promotions as men.", "Closet lesbians fear that \u2018coming out\u2019 could only add more complexity to the employment process.", "An example is Annette Schavan who ran for prime minister of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.", "She was a single woman without children and the press claimed that she was a lesbian.", "Schavan denounced what she considered a false accusation and an extreme insult.", "She lost the election, but her reaction illustrates how detrimental being openly lesbian is believed to be.", "The experts cited in this paper unanimously agreed that what the lesbian community desperately needs are more prominent role models.", "The gay community is represented in almost every walk of life, but lesbian women in prestigious positions are still hesitant to come forward and voice their sexuality.", "Be it for reasons aforementioned or their own personal agenda, the reluctance of these women to come forward perpetuates the hesitation that so many other women have about \u2018coming out.\u2019 With the presence of role models, tentative lesbian women 'coming out' can finally compare themselves to positive, well-known figures.", "The sports world needs to be heavily targeted because it is an area that many young people look up to.", "It is believed that most of the women on Germany\u2019s World Cup soccer squad are lesbian, but they are disinclined to \u2018come out\u2019 because of the discriminatory undertone that accompanies lesbianism.", "Between 5 and 7 percent of individuals in the world are queer.", "Germany has an extremely low number of \u2018out\u2019 homosexual athletes \u2013 less than 1%.", "Likely the low number demonstrates the hesitation in openly joining the queer community.", "It does not make statistical sense that there would be more homosexual men than homosexual women in Germany - especially when places such as San Francisco have an almost equal distribution of homosexuals between the genders.", "Back in the 1990\u2019s the film maker and gay activist Rosa von Praunheim sat on the TV show The Hot Chair and \u2018outed\u2019 some prominent gay men in Germany such as Alfred Biolek and Hape Kerkeling, both TV celebrities.", "While criticized by some as a blatant attack on private life, von Praunheim defended his actions by stating that we are in a time when it is safe to be out and the gay community needs them as role models.", "Perhaps a similar approach should be taken toward closet lesbians.", "Apprehensions about \u2018coming out\u2019 are largely unjustified in a present day Western country \u2013 the majority of those \u2018coming out\u2019 will see little if any consequences from their actions.", "The lesbian community needs them to serve as icons and mediators.", "It needs more recognized faces \u2013 more women that are famous and openly queer.", "Hella von Sinnen and Maren Kroymann are examples of some recognized celebrities that were proud enough to \u2018come out.\u2019 Anne Will \u2013 one of Germany\u2019s most famous news anchors \u2013 depicts a woman who is suspected to be lesbian but refuses to publicly \u2018come out.\u2019 Her reluctance to \u2018come out\u2019 exemplifies what many other German women probably experience.", "While Anne Will is just one example, it is women of this stature that if publicly recognized as lesbians, would act as powerful beacons for the queer community.", "There is no concrete evidence that Will is lesbian, yet if she was, her coming out would act as a powerful beacon for the queer community.", "The Schwules Museum and its materialization

am, I really do flow from that British tradition much more than the American tradition.", "DS: And so I had read all that stuff, you know, growing up as a kid, with Alistair MacLean and Jack Higgins thrown in.", "And so I really felt that my style was an amalgam if you will of some of the more literate writers mixed in with some of the more pure adventure writers.", "And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why the series has worked the way it has.", "HH: But the difference is, if you read Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, or Game, Set, Match, or any of these great novels that are sixes and eights and tens, they\u2019re not as current as your series of books have been in terms of taking headlines out and really\u2026today, in fact, we\u2019re talking, there\u2019s been an attack on the

were saying you try not\u2026 DS: Yes, I stepped on the break.", "I\u2019m so sorry.", "HH: That\u2019s okay.", "You know that, because you were a producer.", "HH: I\u2019ve got to make the music come up a little bit louder.", "But you were saying you try not to let the real news get in the way of your writing.", "HH: And I think that\u2019s a very interesting insight into the struggle.", "DS: I wall off my part of the day where I\u2019m involved in my world.", "And then I come out of that shell briefly, and I live in the real world.", "And then that\u2019s really, it\u2019s a wonderful thing to inhabit two places.", "But I really, I roll out of bed, like most writers, I think, I do a lot of writing in my sleep.", "Graham Greene, I learned a lot of lessons from him.", "And one of the things he did is always read what he wrote that day right before he went to bed.", "And then, you know, I just find that when I roll out of bed, I just grab a cup of coffee, and go down and start writing, because that\u2019s always the most productive time, that first hour that you\u2019re awake.", "HH: And is that, do you set for yourself a discipline that every single day, or at least Monday through Friday, that\u2019s what you do?", "DS: Monk-like, and it is not Monday through Friday.", "I work seven days a week.", "I find it very, very difficult to take days off.", "It\u2019s rather like an actor staying in character on a set, you know.", "If you come out, it\u2019s just harder to get back in.", "I find taking even a single day, when I come back and start writing again, that it takes me a little longer to get back into it, so I try to write every day.", "HH: Do you know where you\u2019re going to end at the beginning of every novel?", "DS: I haven\u2019t the foggiest.", "Haven\u2019t the foggiest.", "I know maybe about a third of it, and I don\u2019t want to know anymore than that.", "I want to bring the characters and the story to life on the page, and then let the characters lead me by the hand to the finish line.", "And I\u2019ve been working with Gabriel long enough to know that at a certain point, you\u2019ve just got to put the story in his hands, and get out of the way.", "HH: Now do you hear the conversation?", "Or do you write it first and then hear it?", "DS: You know, I was, I was, it\u2019s funny you should ask.", "That\u2019s a great question.", "I sometimes feel, particularly when Gabriel is with his mentor, Ari Shamron, that I\u2019m just a mere stenographer, and that these characters have so come to life in my head, they\u2019re so part of our family, that you\u2019re just really kind of writing down what they say.", "It\u2019s not, when you really work on a novel, and you really get that magic, when you get into that clear air, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re making up a story, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re writing down a story that you already know, or you\u2019re remembering a story.", "I know that sounds kind of weird, but it\u2019s, that\u2019s the point where I like to get to, where you\u2019re just, it\u2019s like the memory of the story is so imprinted in your subconscious that you\u2019re just writing down something that you already know.", "HH: You know, there are a couple of recurring places in your books \u2013 Shamron\u2019s villa, the waiting room in the airport where Mossad people go to when they return.", "HH: And when you, do you see that when you\u2019re writing?", "That\u2019s a sort of extension of the question I said about do you hear it.", "Do you see them in those rooms?", "Do you have a vision?", "DS: You bet.", "You bet.", "I mean, one of the things that I\u2019m a stickler for, and is a term that we use called point of view, and that every scene has a point of view through the eyes of a character.", "And sometimes, I\u2019ll go God\u2019s eye and write in a more omniscient point of view.", "But I generally, in the formula of my novels, we\u2019re really with Gabriel 75-80% of the time.", "And so I see things through his eyes.", "And because he\u2019s an artist, he has a very unique vision, and I try to capture that vision.", "And so he\u2019s very observant about certain kinds of things, and I try to use that to my advantage when I\u2019m writing.", "HH: Well, that\u2019s the queue to sort of plunge in now for the audience, and lots of whom have never even heard of Gabriel Alon until this moment.", "And by the way, am I pronouncing his last name the way you pronounce it?", "DS: I do tend to Anglicize it, yeah.", "And in Hebrew, he would be Gavriel, with a V, and Alon would be the way that he would say it in Hebrew.", "But in English, it\u2019s Gabriel Alon.", "HH: All right, and so as we go there, I\u2019ve just got to ask, there are no movies yet out of this series of books.", "HH: And yet I would think that every producer in Hollywood would be trying to get, A) it\u2019s eight books, you know, it\u2019s Pierce Brosnan\u2019s next life as a sort of an aging spy.", "Is it optioned?", "DS: It has been optioned at various points, various books at various times.", "And we have a number of offers on the table, and I\u2019m just making sure that when I do let it go this time that it\u2019s to the right person.", "HH: Oh, good for you, because I love the fact that there\u2019s no actor in my mind when I read this at this point.", "DS: I know, and that is, I don\u2019t have an actor in my mind when I write it.", "I always found that rather strange that people picture actors to fulfill their characters.", "My character is my character, and he looks the way he looks.", "He doesn\u2019t look like someone else.", "HH: Now let\u2019s talk a bit about him.", "He\u2019s a Mossad agent.", "Let\u2019s give the brief history that you, even if you\u2019re starting at the beginning with The Kill Artist, he has a history in The Kill Artist.", "HH: Tell people what it is.", "DS: He is a sabra, meaning that he was born in Israel to the parents of German Holocaust survivors.", "He spoke German, they spoke German at home, so his first language is actually not Hebrew, but German.", "And as I\u2019ve pointed out in a number of books, that he still dreams in German.", "So he has this very split personality in terms of that.", "HH: I messed the queue up this time.", "I was looking at the wrong queue.", "HH: You were saying he\u2019s a sabra, Alon is, born of Holocaust survivors, and still dreaming in German, his first language.", "Pick it up from there, Daniel.", "DS: His grandfather was a famous German Expressionist painter.", "His mother was a very gifted painter.", "And Gabriel was a very gifted painter himself.", "He was studying at the Bezalel Institute of Art in Jerusalem in September, 1972.", "Bezalel is like the national art school in Israel.", "And September, 1972, of course, was the date of the Munich Olympics Massacre.", "And as many people know from the movie Munich, the Israelis put together a team and went after the people who carried out that attack.", "And Gabriel was the primary gunman on that hit team, Operation Wrath of God.", "And he worked on that operation for three years.", "When he came home, he looked different, the stress of it tore him up, and he had also lost the ability to paint.", "And so he studied, went back to Italy and became an art restorer.", "So he\u2019s fixing paintings now.", "And he also from time to time did other sorts of jobs for Israeli intelligence.", "And so that is sort of where he\u2019s at now.", "He is a restorer and sometimes, as I call him, secret servant of Israeli intelligence.", "He has done assassination work, but he\u2019s really much more than an assassin.", "HH: Much more, and he has lost his son and\u2026 DS: And in 1991, while on assignment in Vienna, a terrorist placed a bomb under his car and killed his son, and grievously wounded his wife.", "And she is alive, his first wife, and lives in a psychiatric hospital on Mount Hertzel, and his poor son is buried on Mount of Olives in Israel.", "So he is a, in a way, he is a warning about what happens to people who, and men, in the situation that he have in our country right now, when we decide to fight terrorists on their levels.", "It is not a pretty picture.", "HH: It\u2019s very bracing.", "He\u2019s a hero who has bled, and who has changed as a result.", "HH: If you have been listening in the first hour, you\u2019ll be hooked.", "But if you haven\u2019t, let me tell you to tune in and go back and get that from the podcast sometime.", "We\u2019d begun to talk about the central character of the last eight of Daniel Silva\u2019s eleven novels.", "His name is Gabriel Alon, he is an Isareli, he is a sabra, he is a secret agent, he has been an assassin, he does a lot for the secret service of Israel.", "But he\u2019s also an art restorer, and I want to pick up there, Daniel Silva.", "Did you come to these books with much working knowledge of art?", "DS: Not beyond the odd college art history course, and just a passionate love of art.", "And I just make sure that people who are a lot smarter than me about art read my stuff before it goes to print.", "But I\u2019m actually a good researcher, and careful, and do all my own research when it comes to art.", "HH: Now in the Afterwards of Moscow Rules, you mentioned David Bull, who is an accomplished art restorer himself.", "HH: How did you come across him, and what\u2019s he given you in terms of an appreciation?", "I frankly, until I read your books, I was unaware that such a profession existed, though obviously it had to.", "I just didn\u2019t think about it.", "DS: It had to.", "It has to.", "He was a conservator, or a restorer at the National Gallery of Art in Washington at the time.", "He lived around the corner from me in Georgetown, so he worked for the Gallery, but he also worked privately, and his house was wonderful, because it had no proper, or no serious alarm system on it.", "But he had, his address was fairly private, but you could walk in there, and there would be, you know, easily $200 million dollars worth of art that he would be working on, everything from Van Gogh to Monet to Tishen.", "I mean, it\u2019s just extraordinary.", "And he was just a friend.", "And I had this idea that I wanted to use this as a cover for Gabriel.", "And I said listen, I\u2019m wondering if you could help me turn an Israeli assassin into an Italian art restorer.", "And he said sure, no problem.", "And so we pieced together how, where he would have studied, and how he goes about his work.", "HH: How fascinating.", "Let\u2019s dig into that for a second, because obviously, there comes a moment in the life of Daniel Silva where Alon erupts like Athena.", "HH: And when was that, because this is just not your ordinary assassin.", "DS: No, and it was, the funny thing is that he was never supposed to be a continuing character.", "And I had to be talked into making him a continuing character, because I was deeply concerned about, look, you know, it\u2019s no secret that a lot of people don\u2019t like Israel very much.", "HH: Are you Jewish, by the way?", "HH: Okay.", "I didn\u2019t know that, and Silva\u2019s an unusual name.", "DS: I was actually raised Catholic and converted to Judaism as an adult.", "But there\u2019s a tremendous amount of anti-Israelism in the world, particularly in Western Europe, and also, you know, no small amount of anti-Semitism.", "And I was just deeply concerned whether you could take an Israeli and turn him into a palatable continuing character for an American audience.", "And I was told that my concerns were way off base, and it was the best piece of advice I ever got.", "And I wrote it, the second book that I wrote about Gabriel had nothing to do with terrorism.", "It was a book about Switzerland and the Second World War\u2026 DS: \u2026and Nazi art looting, a book that I had wanted to write for a long time.", "And I took Gabriel, dropped him into this completely different setting, and it worked beautifully, and sold probably twice as many books at the previous one.", "HH: Now you cannot expect me to just wander.", "You\u2019ve blown up my outline now, so I have to go back\u2026 HH: But to be raised Catholic and then to become a Jew is an interesting, and I\u2019m sure a lot of people say well stop there, Hugh.", "What was that about?", "When did that happen?", "DS: Okay, (laughing) we\u2019re going to go straight for the heart of the matter.", "DS: It happened as an adult.", "I was raised in a very strict Catholic home.", "HH: Were you an altar boy?", "DS: And while I was always a person of considerable faith, and loved the Church, I am, was not truly a doctrinal Christian, if you get my meaning.", "I was much more a God person, and am more comfortable doctrinally as a Jew than I was a Roman Catholic and a Christian.", "And so I have\u2026anyone who reads, for example, a book like The Messenger, where Gabriel works to, saves the life of the Holy Father, the Pope, knows that, can probably read between the lines and see that I still have a great reverence and love and respect for the Roman Catholic Church.", "I mean, I have a continuing character in the novel, the Pope\u2019s private\u2026in the series, excuse me.", "DS: The Pope\u2019s private secretary, Luigi, Donati.", "And the Pope himself is a continuing character.", "So there are some little clues in there about my split religious past.", "HH: You know, I\u2019m not going to say it explains everything, but boy, it\u2019s quite part of the tumbler that you\u2019ve got to unlock here.", "DS: And also, I also fell in love with a Jewish woman, and wanted my children to be raised Jewish, and didn\u2019t want to be different from them.", "HH: Now how observant are you?", "DS: We belong to a very nice synagogue in Washington, D. C. We celebrate the holidays, and Shabbat, and children were just, I have twins, so he had what is known as a B\u2019nai Mitzvah, where they were Bar Mitzvah at the same time.", "HH: Well, congratulations on that.", "DS: That was the best day of my life.", "HH: How often have you been to Israel?", "HH: And when did you actually convert?", "You have to go through that process, as I understand.", "DS: Gosh, what year was it now?", "It was actually after I started writing the Gabriel series, shortly after.", "HH: That is so fascinating.", "How has it informed how deep you go into the Israeli side of the book?", "Because a lot of it is Europe, obviously, but there\u2019s also these intermittent periods in Israel.", "And how much has that impacted your desire to get deeper into it?", "DS: I\u2019m not sure.", "That is a good question, and I don\u2019t know that I can answer it.", "Gabriel, like most Israelis of his generation, was raised in a deeply secular home.", "DS: And you know, the Holocaust had a terrible impact on many Jews that caused them to lose their faith.", "And many of the Jews who came to Israel, and that either before the formation of the state of Israel and after were very, very secular.", "And people really don\u2019t quite grasp that.", "Israel has gotten more religious as time has gone by.", "And the religious community is wielding more and more power now.", "But at its formation, it was a very secular place, and that was reflected in Gabriel\u2019s life.", "I think I wrote in A Death In Vienna, there\u2019s a scene where Gabriel is watching Ari Shamron\u2019s wife light Shabbat candles, and he had never seen, it\u2019s something that had not been done in his home.", "He had been raised in a home without religion.", "HH: So what is Daniel Silva\u2019s view of God and how He works in the world?", "DS: (laughing) Are we going to do this on a radio program?", "DS: I don\u2019t know that I could put that into something that could go on a radio show, but I definitely believe that God exists, and that God plays a role in my life, and\u2026 HH: Let me put it this way.", "Is He active in using individuals to accomplish His purposes in this world?", "DS: That is one of the great mysteries, and I don\u2019t know the answer to that.", "I really don\u2019t.", "HH: What does Gabriel think?", "DS: I think about it all the time, and I would hope so, but I\u2019m not sure, because you have to account for an awful lot of evil in the world.", "And I don\u2019t know how to explain that.", "HH: Yeah, I was just in D. C. a couple of weeks ago, and went to the Holocaust Museum for the first time.", "And you can see how obviously it would shatter many people\u2019s faith.", "It\u2019s the problem of evil.", "DS: Yes.", "I did a lot of research there.", "There is a wonderful research institute up top in the Holocaust Museum, and have spent a lot of time there, and Yad Vashem in Israel.", "And to walk down that, there\u2019s wonderful exhibits in the Holocaust Museum.", "Two of them are the ones that haunt me \u2013 the shoes are awful\u2026 DS: And then that, they took a shtetl from either a Lithuanian or Latvian, I can\u2019t remember, and just put the photographs of everyone who died.", "HH: Yeah, it goes for two stories.", "Yup, two stories of them.", "DS: And to walk through there, two floors of faces, and to have them gaze at you, it is easy to understand why people would think that they had been forsaken by God.", "HH: Daniel, let\u2019s go back to Israel for a second.", "Obviously, you are very sympathetic to the state of Israel, as I am, as this audience generally is, extraordinarily so.", "I am wondering if that has evoked hostility from some parts of your audience who must come away thinking that you are so pro-Israel that you can\u2019t be giving fairness\u2026not having read it, by the way.", "I think you\u2019re very, very fair to some of the Palestinians and Arabs that we encounter along the books\u2019 way.", "But what\u2019s been the reaction of the reading public to this point of view?", "DS: I mean, for the most part, the readers of the series like it, but I get my share of people who fling me the ugly letter now and again, and send me the ugly e-mail.", "And you know, I just brush it off.", "I mean, look, if you take the two books that deal with the Palestinian question, The Kill Artist and The Prince Of Fire, the Palestinian characters in those novels are deeply sympathetic.", "DS: And you know, for the record, Daniel Silva is a devout two-stater, okay?", "DS: I believe that there should be a Palestinian state living side by side with the state of Israel.", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get there anytime soon, but I believe that.", "The two books that deal with global jihadism, The Messenger and The Secret Servant, they are not sympathetic towards the global jihadists.", "I don\u2019t have any sympathies toward the global jihadists, the people who want to create a caliphate and drive us from the Middle East, and will use any grotesque act of violence to achieve that end.", "There\u2019s no sympathy for them.", "I have no sympathy for them, and they\u2019re rather unsympathetic characters in the books.", "HH: Now do you think that the counterparts to Ari Shamron, the head of Mossad, the Israeli Secret Service, and Gabriel Alon are losing sleep as we speak over Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader, not Ahmadinejad, but Khatami and all the other mullahs running around Iran who have launched ballistic missiles on this day that we talk?", "DS: No question.", "No question.", "I\u2019ve had many conversations with Israeli officials about this, and I come away with two impressions.", "Once I was told by a senior Mossad official, do you really think that we are going to sit around and do nothing while they develop a nuclear bomb?", "Do you really think that?", "But then the second thing that strikes me every time I have this conversation, is that when they talk about using the military option to deal with it, it usually is preceded by the words God forbid, because they know that if they have to do it, it is going to turn the Middle East into a cauldron.", "Also, the Iranians have very cleverly created two proxy armies on Israel\u2019s border, one in the north called Hezbollah, and one in the south called Hamas.", "It is now estimated that Hezbollah has about 42,000 short-range missiles in rockets.", "Remember a couple of years ago when Israel went to war briefly with Hezbollah.", "Maybe the estimate then was about 15,000.", "They have re-armed, they are armed to the teeth, and Israel knows that if it strikes at Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, that Hezbollah is going to be able to launch an extraordinarily violent retaliatory strike that will probably depopulate the north of Israel.", "So regardless of who does it under these scenarios, whether it\u2019s the United States or Israel, Israel is going to be the one that\u2019s going to pay the short term price.", "HH: And there\u2019s also an article on the day we taped this in the Gloria Center\u2019s publication on Fortress Gaza, and how the same thing has now happened on the southern border, and including an armament escalation to rival that of Hezbollah\u2019s on the northern border.", "DS: I got some really interesting intelligence on that recently during a briefing, that the Iranians are putting the kinds of weapons into Gaza that\u2026they are not just the little Qassam rockets there anymore.", "They are putting much more serious stuff in there.", "HH: That\u2019s what the Gloria Center\u2019s Jonathan Spyer said.", "Well, how often do you talk with Israeli intelligence people?", "DS: Every now and again, but I don\u2019t, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m sitting there with them working through my plots, or asking them how to do things.", "I mean, after eight books, these characters, I have my own\u2026in fact, I don\u2019t call my service the Mossad, as readers know.", "I refer to it as the Office.", "I never say what their real name is.", "And I wanted to just create some distance between my family of characters and the real thing.", "HH: How do the real thing react to your books?", "DS: (laughing) They like it, obviously.", "And they sometimes, I\u2019m told about little quarrels and disagreements for some people.", "They\u2019ll go well, that\u2019s me, and that\u2019s me.", "But look, it\u2019s, I think that they\u2019re as surprised as I am that a character from the Israeli secret services appears at the top of the bestseller list in this country.", "HH: Now it\u2019s been an honor to know a few Agency people on the operations side.", "And they\u2019re never as exotic as Gabriel.", "They live ordinary lives in places like Reston and Vienna, and that\u2019s Vienna, Virginia.", "HH: Oakton, and places like that.", "What do they think of these books, because they come off a little bit, and we\u2019ll talk about this, unwilling to get their hands dirty, a little Dartmouthy, a little, generally speaking, let Mossad do it in your books.", "DS: Well, that is, in the last couple of books, Gabriel has worked in a way almost as a subcontractor for the CIA.", "And I know that there are many fans of the series that work at Langley.", "But look, the war on terrorism, these guys are getting their hands dirty all over the place.", "And it\u2019s coming back to bite them, actually.", "And lots of people at Langley and elsewhere are lawyering up, as they say, because there\u2019s going to be some trouble ahead over some of the tactics that we employed during the war on terrorism.", "HH: How often do you talk with the Americans in the business?", "DS: Well, I have lots of friends in the business, so it can tend, I see CIA agents and undercover officers socially all the time.", "HH: Is the tradecraft imagined or taught?", "DS: In terms of my novels?", "DS: It is, I use established tradecraft where I can, and quite frankly, I make up the rest.", "DS: I mean, I\u2019m not going to, you\u2019ve got to focus on what is important, and that is the characters.", "And the tradecraft is interesting to a point\u2026 HH: Well, like the Smiley novels, it\u2019s a wonderful hook.", "There\u2019s tradecraft in the Smiley novels, and there\u2019s tradecraft in the Alon novels.", "It\u2019s kind of a fun aspect, and I was just wondering if it was made up or if someone had actually\u2026 DS: But I use terms and their tradecraft where I can and where I want to, and I invent or create an amalgam of tradecraft where I need to.", "HH: Daniel, Munich matters.", "Here we are just a couple of weeks before the opening of the Beijing Olympics, and Munich matters a lot in your eight Gabriel Alon novels.", "HH: And you were 12 at the time.", "I was 16.", "Do you recall watching Jim McKay through all those hours?", "DS: It is seared into my memory.", "And it was, it just hit me at the right age where my receptors were open, and it is just\u2026and I also was a very serious, young runner as a kid, and had dreams, unfulfilled dreams, of maybe being in the Olympics someday.", "And so I watched the Olympics religiously.", "And it was just awful.", "DS: And I watch all the films, and watch Munich, and watch One Day In September, and see it all played out again, and it just still makes me sick to my stomach, and makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.", "HH: Yeah, I try to convey to young people, you just couldn\u2019t get away from the television.", "HH: And there was nothing on the television.", "You just watched for hours.", "DS: Yeah, and it, I think it was like for Gabriel, it was a turning point in his life, it was also a turning point in my life.", "I mean, this was, it wasn\u2019t the 9/11 in terms of its loss of life and destruction of property, but it was a sort of tear in the curtain, if you will, of human decency, that this happened, and that frankly, that the Games resumed the next day.", "DS: and so it affected me deeply as a child, and it\u2019s just strange that I came to write about a character involved in it.", "HH: Now the passion that\u2019s in the books, on Page 144 of the new book, Moscow Rules, you have Adrian Carter, the CIA deputy director for operations, whatever his title is, say, \u201cIt has become popular in Washington these days to think that the threat of terrorism has receded, that we can live with the occasional loss of national monuments and American life.", "But when the next attacks come, and I do mean when, Gabriel, the same free thinkers will be the first to fault the Agency for failing to stop it.\u201d It\u2019s a little bit of a sermon, one that I welcome the delivery of\u2026 HH: But you live there in D. C. And whenever I go there, I\u2019m astonished that here we are at Ground Zero, the target that they always come back to.", "There is this almost unworldly air of nonchalance.", "DS: But I was in Aspen a few days ago, before publication, I should say.", "And a very senior official from the Department of Homeland Security was there, and was having conversations, it was during the Ideas Festival, and predicted that the odds of an attack in the United States before the election was 50/50 or better.", "There is a thought that al Qaeda will try to influence the election or give President Bush a send-off to remember.", "And so I think that the, I don\u2019t know if I would agree that it\u2019s that high.", "I have no basis to form that opinion.", "But I do think that we are in a period of time when the chances of an attack are elevated.", "DS: That doesn\u2019t mean that they have the capability to do it, either.", "I mean, you know, it is quite possible that we are actually winning this thing called the war on terrorism.", "It\u2019s not something you hear a lot, but we have degraded al Qaeda substantially, and I\u2019m not sure that they can carry one off.", "HH: I spent a lot of time talking to people like Lawrence Wright, Robin Wright, the folks who wrote The Nuclear Jihadist, et cetera, because I think we\u2019re living in this unworldly era.", "But does that sense of urgency inform how you go about your books?", "Or are you just a storyteller?", "DS: No, I mean, look, I live in Washington, D. C. I could sit in my house in Georgetown and see what looked like a Mount St. Helens cloud of smoke rising up from the Pentagon.", "And it was not as bad in Washington as it was in New York, obviously, but you know, people streaming out of downtown Washington, up Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue, the White House complex being evacuated, Capitol Hill being evacuated, I don\u2019t want to live through another day like that again.", "And I hope to God we don\u2019t.", "HH: And when you talk to people outside of Aspen, though, is that alarm, in your opinion, sufficiently widely spread and understood?", "Not among the government, but among the chattering class which you used to supervise at CNN, and obviously, you\u2019ve got friends in the chattering class still.", "Do they get it?", "DS: They do, but I get the sense that we have, consciously or unconsciously, have entered, or are about to enter the post-9/11 world.", "And it was always the danger of declaring war on terrorism, that a long time, a long slog, things have been done that we\u2019re not exactly proud of.", "And I have a feeling that it\u2019s all about to wear off, and we\u2019re about to walk through that doorway into a post-9/11 world.", "HH: I do want to anchor people on Ari Shamron as well, Daniel Silva.", "We were talking last time about how Alon was influence by Munich.", "Shamron is, in your book, the man who grabbed Eichmann.", "HH: And when people read Eichmann, I\u2019ll bet you not a lot of them have any idea of the significance of that.", "Is part of his role to kind of educate people on the pre-Munich history of Israel, and what it did and how it survived?", "DS: Perhaps.", "But he is, you know, he is a blend of a number of different legendary Mossad figures.", "And I took a little from this one, and a little from that one.", "But really, his defining moment was the capture of Adolf Eichmann.", "And there is a little dispute within Israel intelligence about who actually was the one who clamped their hands around the guy.", "HH: Really?", "How can they not know?", "DS: Because a couple of figures fought over that mantle, unfortunately.", "But in my world, it was the young intelligence officer named Ari Shamron, who was, had an unusually powerful grip for such a small man.", "And he actually had to grab him and get him to the car.", "And it just changed his life, as one would think.", "HH: Now one of the things I like about your book is that not only does it pay a lot of respect to the Israeli secret services, but it also demonstrates repeatedly they\u2019re not perfect.", "There\u2019s this image of oh, you know, Entebbe and all this other stuff, that they can go anywhere at any time.", "But in fact, they screw up a lot in these books, and I like that.", "DS: They screw up a lot, because while, you know, when I created, part of the subtext of the first one, that The Restorer, Gabriel Alon, was that I wrote it at a time when Mossad had really bungled a bunch of serious cases in a row.", "And there was a lot of talk that they\u2019d lost their touch.", "They tried to kill Khalid Mashal, the head of Hamas in Jordan, and had failed.", "And they lost a team in Europe that was arrested in Switzerland trying to plant a simple bug.", "You know, they\u2019d really seemed to lose their way and lose their touch.", "And it was against that backdrop that that I wrote the first Gabriel book.", "And the analogy or the metaphor of restoration was something that was important.", "But look, they play in a very rough neighborhood, and they are willing to do things that traditional services are unwilling to do, simply because look, they live on the razor\u2019s edge there.", "A nuclear bomb in Iran looks one way to the people of the Netherlands, and looks a very different way to the people of Israel.", "HH: What\u2019s interesting is the tension over many of the books between the European services, whether it\u2019s MI-5 or the French and the Italian and the Israeli services.", "Do you think that\u2019s real?", "Is that how it really plays out, that they have\u2026 DS: It is, I take some dramatic license, but for the most part, Israel has pretty good relations with the European security services, for the simple fact that the Israelis offer the people of Europe much more protection than the people of Europe understand, that they are a source of a lot of intelligence about the movements of terrorists.", "And so they are a conduit of intel and information for the security services and intelligence services of Europe.", "That said, the Israelis have a record of doing things on European soil that the Europeans don\u2019t like.", "And so there\u2019s, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s unfair to create some tension between Gabriel Alon and the various security services of Europe.", "HH: Oh, it\u2019s a fascinating aspect.", "And by the way, in your last book, The Secret Servant, five members of an Amsterdam Mosque go missing, and it\u2019s picked up on.", "Do you think the level of surveillance and competence is in fact that deep, among those who watch the jihadists?", "DS: Yes, I do.", "I know for a fact that you take various mosques in Germany, for example, and they are seriously penetrated.", "Look, there was a wonderful piece in Commentary Magazine this month that took an overall look at the global war on terrorism, and asked the question are we winning.", "And one of the dark spots, in the view of the author of this piece, was the subject of The Secret Servant, and that is Western Europe, and to the extent to which jihadists are embedded within the European communities, and the threat that European passport holders, for example, can create for this country.", "But if you take a typical radical mosque in Germany, the German services are all over it.", "They\u2019re working with services in the Middle East, they have bugged these places, they are working very, very hard to keep an eye on the terrorists that they know are within their midst.", "I mean, the head of MI-5 knows that he\u2019s got several thousand committed jihadists living in the United Kingdom, and cells that are operating.", "This is just a fact of life about what\u2019s going on in some European countries.", "HH: And do you try and read, as we\u2019ve got about 45 seconds, do you try and read the jihadist literature to get inside their heads in the way, for example, you said you have no sympathy for them, but do you try and\u2026 DS: Yes, I do, and I understand what makes them tick.", "I think that one of the things that I did well in The Secret Servant\u2026 DS: \u2026was how to take these two characters, Ibrahim and Isac, and explain how the father went in one direction, and the son went in a completely different direction.", "HH: A couple of quick questions before we go to break.", "Food and drink play quite a lot a role in all of the Alon books.", "How much of a eater and a drinker are you, Daniel Silva?", "DS: (laughing) I am not.", "I eat a really simple, healthy diet, and I really don\u2019t touch alcohol beyond the glass of wine with dinner.", "HH: So someone must be cluing you in.", "DS: (laughing) But I do go to Italy a fair amount.", "The funny thing about the Alon books is that I do more research for the art aspects sometimes than I do for the thriller and plot parts.", "And so you know, one of my tough duties is to go to Israel and look at paintings and talk to art experts there.", "I mean, I heard that you\u2019re going to Venice.", "DS: And so you get to see some of Gabriel\u2019s work there.", "HH: I know.", "He\u2019s done the Bellini Altarpiece, and we\u2019re going to come back, and I\u2019ll reread that on the plane over there.", "Let me ask you, though, about the Gary Larson temptation.", "When anyone I like a lot gets really successful, I worry that they\u2019re just going to say okay, I\u2019m done now, like Gary Larson did with The Far Side.", "What\u2019s the trajectory for Alon?", "How long do you think you\u2019ll be doing this?", "DS: I don\u2019t know, but I have no, I have books that I\u2019d like to get to.", "But I love the characters, I love the stories.", "At a certain point, characters, you know, stop aging in readers\u2019 minds, and so it\u2019s not a question of the character getting too old to do these types of things.", "And it\u2019s really a question of how long I want to do it before I move on to other things.", "And I don\u2019t know the answer to that question.", "I never planned to write a series in the first place.", "HH: Are your family tired of Gabriel?", "HH: Does she ever turn to you and stay stop being Gabriel?", "DS: (laughing) No, they\u2019ve really become, I always looked, had a little bit of a skeptical reaction when I heard authors talk about their continuing characters, and how they are alive in their lives.", "And I am not skeptical about that anymore.", "And he is as real to me as anyone else in my family.", "HH: And how much of a day, how much does he enter into the mental life of Daniel Silva on an average day, when you\u2019re not writing.", "DS: Well, he\u2019s there, definitely.", "And when I\u2019m writing, it\u2019s just, he\u2019s at my shoulder the whole time.", "I give little hints about my own work habits through his work habits.", "And there are times where I describe Bellini standing at Gabriel\u2019s shoulder helping him finish a painting.", "And that\u2019s how I feel with him sometimes.", "HH: You\u2019re on one of these killer promotion tours.", "I guess you have to do 33 stops on this book tour, Daniel Silva?", "DS: I\u2019m holding in my hand a special shirt that we had made up for the tour.", "It looks like one of those old Rolling Stones tour shirts, you know, the baseball sleeves with all the cities on the back?", "It\u2019s how I spent my summer vacation.", "It is 33 stops.", "And it\u2019s hard, but it gives me a chance to go out and spend some time with my readers, and I just love it.", "And so it\u2019s\u2026I get to really see the state of the U. S. airline industry.", "DS: You know, in a very personal way, because I fly every morning, basically.", "HH: I can\u2019t imagine.", "I\u2019ve done it for a week at a time.", "I just can\u2019t imagine it.", "But it\u2019s 33 days of the same questions, in essence.", "DS: It\u2019s\u2026actually, I really do enjoy it.", "DS: It\u2019s the travel and the time away from my family that\u2019s the hard part.", "HH: Before we dive into the novels themselves, I want to ask one question that touches them all, because Gabriel Alon is a restorer of art.", "You always have some artist or art piece at the center of the book.", "Sometimes it\u2019s Bellini, it\u2019s been Rubens, it\u2019s, in the current book, Mary Cassatt.", "How do you pick them?", "DS: I pick them very carefully in terms of I want imagery that reinforces something in the novel itself.", "Obviously, in the new book, there\u2019s a painting called Two Children On A Beach by Mary Cassatt.", "And those two children on a beach, without giving anything away, play a very important role in the outcome of the story.", "DS: If memory serves, the Rubens was Daniel In The Lion\u2019s Den that he restored.", "HH: Right.", "You made up a Van Gogh.", "DS: I made up a painting that was based on the facts.", "Marguerite Gachet, I create an additional painting of Marguerite Gachet that Vincent made near the end of his life.", "HH: And so when you start at the book, do you look around for someone whose life or drama will interest you?", "Or do you look for a painting that will fit into the plot?", "DS: Sometimes it\u2019s just when he was working in Venice, for example, it was just picking something that David and I wanted to restore, basically.", "Gosh I like that Bellini, let\u2019s do that one.", "And then you know, where the paintings are really part of the plot, as they were in The Messenger and in this book, that I want something, I want to create an image in the reader\u2019s mind and on the canvas that also has something to do with the plot.", "HH: There\u2019s also a fascinating aspect here, the world of art dealing, which has been in all of the books, but mostly in The Secret Servant and the current one, and in the attempt for a collector to get the Cassatt, or for a collector to get the Van Gogh.", "HH: And the middlemen and the money.", "They might not like your work too much, because they don\u2019t come off\u2026 DS: And yes, I actually was at the, given a big book party a couple of years ago in New York by dealers and curators and things.", "And Gabriel is very, very well known within the restoration and the art community.", "HH: Did you have any idea how vast it was when you began down this road?", "DS: I really didn\u2019t, but a couple of years ago, when a very famous art restorer was giving a lecture at the Tate Gallery in London, and quoted from Gabriel Alon in the lecture, that\u2019s when I knew that Gabriel had really come to life.", "HH: All right, let\u2019s go back to the start, and I want to do sort of a force march through the previous seven, and then I\u2019m going to spend a lot of time on Moscow Rules.", "HH: The Kill Artist is the first Alon book.", "How different is the Alon of 2000 when it comes out from the Alon of this summer in terms of the full nature of the character and its availability to you?", "DS: Much different.", "At that point, he had fled his old service, was living in isolation, basically, in Cornwall in the far southwest of England.", "He was tending to his wife who was in a British mental institution because of the wounds and the psychological, psychiatric trauma that she had suffered.", "And he was a surly, rather broken figure who was hauled out of the dustbin to track down the man who destroyed his family.", "And so he has grown up and changed.", "And he was really a lone wolf, very shy, a difficult personality, not a guy that you\u2019d really want to hang around with.", "HH: Arafat is in that book, as historical personages appear through all of them.", "HH: It\u2019s sort of dangerous to do that.", "How do you manage sort of that you\u2019re writing in real time with real characters?", "Obviously, Arafat died thereafter, but not during the course of the book.", "DS: He appears in two novels, and the first book was written during a period at the end of the Clinton administration where we were really having a go at peacemaking, and President Clinton tried but failed to bring the parties together at Camp David.", "And this novel is, the plot of it is that a Palestinian rejectionist group is going to try to torpedo the process by carrying out acts of terrorism on European and American soil.", "And you know, you have to make the decision, do I want to create a fictitious Palestinian leader?", "Or do I want to go with the real thing?", "I mean, when you look at the Palestinian people, Arafat, for warts and all, is the leader, or was the leader of the Palestinian people.", "He was Palestinian nationalism personified.", "And to try to create a fictitious person, fictitious Arafat, was just, I just didn\u2019t think I was going to be able to do it.", "HH: Couldn\u2019t be done, yeah.", "Second book is The English Assassin.", "It\u2019s in Switzerland, you mentioned it earlier in our program.", "You\u2019re digging into the Holocaust, and to their horrible past, banking the Nazis.", "But you also have a violinist in here, kind of, one of the characters is a great but fractured talent.", "So you had to learn a couple\u2026you had to learn banking and you had to learn violin music.", "How long does that take you to do?", "DS: That\u2019s a great question.", "And I worked very hard on the musical aspects of that plot, and spent a lot of time with a very gifted violinist, and just tried to learn how she thinks, just the way I learned how Gabriel would think as a restorer, just to try to get inside the head of a gifted violinist with a disturbing and violent past.", "And so I had to do a lot of research on it.", "And it was actually a very successful character, and I thought about bringing her back, actually.", "HH: So you had a violinist?", "Oh\u2026 DS: And Gabriel kind of had to move on in his life.", "HH: That\u2019s interesting, because you did use a violinist, though, to sit down and kind of\u2026that\u2019s fascinating.", "HH: All right.", "The Confessor is book number three.", "The artist at the center of it is Bellini, the bad guy is the Leopard, but this time, we\u2019ve got Vatican\u2026it\u2019s the first Vatican thing.", "And you know, after the Da Vinci Code, a lot of people are going to be suspicious of twisting the Vatican around, but you\u2019re very sympathetic.", "I understand now why, you grew up Catholic.", "But you still have the Crux Vera in here, et cetera.", "What\u2019s your attitude towards the Vatican?", "DS: Let me just separate that out from what the story was about, and that was the level of complicity of the Roman Catholic Church in the Holocaust, and the failure of Pope Pius XII to speak out more forcefully in condemnation of the Holocaust.", "And this book explores the possibility of was there some sort of pact between the Germans and elements of the Roman Catholic Church to buy the Pope\u2019s silence, and that\u2019s what the story is about.", "But as I said in the first hour, I am, you know, I\u2019m not some Vatican hater.", "DS: Or Vatican conspiratorialist, actually.", "I\u2019m fascinated by the place.", "I have read deeply of the history of the Church and the Vatican.", "It\u2019s funny, a couple of summers ago, I took a private tour of the Vatican, and its museums, with the chief art historian.", "And near the end of the tour, he says you know, I have taken a lot of people through this place.", "You know more about the Vatican than anyone I have every brought in here, because then I finally confessed who I was and why I\u2019d spent so much time studying the Vatican.", "So that dealt with a specific aspect of the Vatican\u2019s past that I caught a lot of flack for from some quarters, but I think it was a fair book.", "HH: Three down, five to go.", "Don\u2019t go anywhere.", "HH: We\u2019re on book number four, A Death In Vienna.", "And on this aspect, it\u2019s really about survivors.", "There\u2019s a lot of Holocaust history here.", "And do you, do survivors talk to you much about how they and their experience are depicted in the Alon books?", "DS: Absolutely.", "Every single time I go to an event, or I make lots of speeches and appearances at synagogues and Jewish community centers around the country.", "And look, A Death In Vienna is probably my personal favorite.", "And as anyone who\u2019s read the book knows, that the heart of the novel is a fictitious testimony that I wrote concerning Gabriel\u2019s, the experiences of Gabriel\u2019s mother during the death march from Auschwitz.", "DS: And her tormentor.", "And writing it left me a personal wreck, and I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.", "But it remains I think the thing that I\u2019m most proud of.", "And a lot of work went into it.", "I mean, I went to Yad Vashem and read the real things in Yiddish, written on the old parchment paper that after the state of Israel was founded, people streamed in and gave these testimonies quietly to the record keepers.", "And it just remains my personal favorite book.", "HH: You know, the service it does, to pay you a little compliment here, it\u2019s extraordinary given that we live in sort of an era of casual Holocaust denial, where you get these fanatics like Ahmadinejad, and it\u2019s become so routine.", "They are, in fact, accomplishing their purpose by diminishing it.", "DS: Well, Holocaust denial was the spine of that novel.", "DS: That the bad guy, for lack of a better word, the Nazi war criminal that Gabriel is trying to bring to justice, his job was to erase the evidence of the Holocaust to the extent possible in the German-occupied lands in the east.", "And you know what?", "They succeeded to a large degree.", "When the Poles and the Russians went to look for Treblinka, they could barely find the place.", "And if you\u2019ve ever been there as I have, it\u2019s tucked away in the woods.", "They did a good job trying to clean up all the evidence.", "And they kind of made it disappear for a

Church endured.", "There just wasn\u2019t any training.", "DS: Yeah, I think that you can\u2019t underestimate the influence of Orthodoxy on the course of Russian history, or the influence of Catholicism on Polish history.", "And I do think that the fact that Poland is so devoutly Catholic, and anyone of Polish descent knows that, or anyone who\u2019s visited Poland, you know, you can\u2019t drive more than a handful of miles down any country road without coming on a lovely shrine to the Madonna.", "I mean, it is a devoutly Catholic place.", "And I think that that has probably played some role in Poland\u2019s current situation.", "But they are more anchored to Western Europe than some of the weaker satellites close to Russia.", "And this is part of Russia\u2019s plan.",

days, we knew what the Soviets wanted\u2026 HH: \u2026because they had an ideology that told us.", "But fascists are more difficult to figure out.", "What do you think it is?", "DS: Well, clearly they want to be, they do not like the unipolar world of the post-Cold War.", "They want it to be bipolar again.", "They want to be, they want to be a member of the Western club, meaning the G-8 and some of the other institutions, but they also want to challenge it, and to be a counterweight to the United States in the world.", "To that end, I mean, they are clearly seeking to exploit the unpopularity of the United States in the Islamic world by, you know, holding themselves up as the true defender of Islam.", "And they\u2019re selling weapons to the Syrians like crazy.", "They are selling weapons to the Iranians.", "I mean, if we talked earlier about a possible strike on the Iranian nuclear facilities, if that ever happens, God forbid, the Iranians will defend those facilities with weapons that were sold to them by the Russians.", "So thank you, Vladimir Putin.", "HH: When you say God forbid\u2026 DS: Yeah, I hope it doesn\u2019t come to this.", "I mean, I really\u2026I don\u2019t know

my knowledge from what I\u2019ve been told by the experts, is that we can at best delay the Iranians.", "And maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing.", "I mean\u2026but you have to accept that the world is going to come out of that, that post-attack world is going to be pretty, pretty uncertain for a while.", "DS: And look out for $250 dollar oil.", "HH: I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed as much as I have this

www.danielsilvabooks.com, Moscow Rules, of course, now in fine bookstores, airports, available from Amazon.com.", "I want to conclude because while you center these books, Daniel Silva, on Israel and Alon, there\u2019s a lot of looking at America in it.", "And you have one line on Page 135 of Moscow Rules which I wrote down, \u201cThe Americans love to monitor problems, but do nothing about

likes kidneys or livers or human brains.", "And so these characters are Israeli intelligence officers.", "And they, the one thing I\u2019ve learned from spending time with them is that they are acerbic, they are funny as hell, they have a point of view, and my characters sometimes talk like them.", "And so everything that Gabriel Alon says, or Ari Shamron says\u2026 HH: Yeah, this is Shamron.", "But what do you think of his assessment then?", "DS: What is my assessment?", "HH: What is your assessment of Shamron\u2019s assessment, that the Americans love to monitor problems but do nothing about them?", "DS: I think that that\u2019s fair.", "I mean, we\u2019ve been talking a lot about the need to diversify our energy supplies here in the United States, and boy, we\u2019ve been

though he had some concern over possible perceptions arising from the chief justice\u2019s former association with the Liberal Party.", "He believed that the chief justice would be willing to advise him.", "Sir John also said that, if the Senate were to defer or fail to grant supply, it would be necessary to allow some time to pass in order to test the Senate\u2019s resolve.", "13.", "Coming now to the October conversations and our discussion of Mr Ellicott\u2019s view, as related to me by Sir John, that the governor-general should take immediate action to resolve the crisis, I said to Sir John that, if he considered it legitimate or necessary to consult the chief justice, it would be unwise to do so at that time as the chief justice might agree with Mr Ellicott\u2019s view that immediate action be taken.", "But I did not describe or regard that view as \u201cradical\u201d.", "Nor did I describe the consequences as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d or \u201cdisastrous\u201d.", "14.", "I certainly did not agree to give a written opinion on the Law Officers\u2019 advice or on the Ellicott document (which I had not seen), as Sir John claims, though I had suggested that he should ask the prime minister to obtain the Law Officers\u2019 opinion on the governor-general\u2019s power to terminate the commission of the prime minister.", "Sir John said he would do that.", "I did not receive a copy of the Ellicott document, despite Sir John\u2019s claim to the contrary.", "15.", "At about this time Sir John informed me that the prime minister had agreed, at Sir John\u2019s request, to him seeing the leader of the opposition (Mr Fraser).", "Sir John did not discuss with me how this came about.", "Nor did he ever communicate to me his conversations with Mr Fraser, except to say later that the Senate remained firm in its resolve in not granting supply, a statement which I assumed was based on information provided by Mr Fraser.", "Nor did Sir John ever discuss with me his conversations with Mr Hayden about the government\u2019s financial position.", "16.", "Sir John was very much aware of the possibility that the prime minister might seek to have him removed from office.", "Apart from his account to me of his conversation with Mr Yeend, he told me of the prime minister\u2019s remark before the state banquet in honour of the prime minister of Malaysia, \u201cIt could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall or you get in first with my dismissal\u201d.", "17.", "About a week before Sunday, November 9, 1975, I had a conversation with Sir John at Admiralty House.", "In this conversation he said that he had not received the Law Officers\u2019 opinion and did not know the reason for the delay.", "Sir John asked me whether, in the event that the issue of the dismissal of the prime minister were to go to the High Court, the chief justice would sit if he had given a written opinion on the matter.", "I replied that I did not know the answer to that question.", "Sir John did not ask me whether, in the event that the matter went to the High Court, I would sit on the case.", "Nor did he ask me for my view on the likelihood of the matter going to the High Court.", "There was no discussion of either of these questions.", "Whatever may be thought now, at the time I was of the view that the matter was unlikely to come before the High Court.", "18.", "Towards the end of our conversation, Sir John said that he would resolve the crisis one way or the other without asking for a written opinion from the chief justice or \u201canother member of the High Court\u201d.", "I think that it was in the course of that conversation and not later that Sir John said that the prime minister had told him that he (Sir John) was not to consult the chief justice but he did not disclose when and in what circumstances the prime minister had made that statement.", "19.", "Our next conversation, the first conversation on November 9, took place at what I understood to be Lady Kerr\u2019s house in North Sydney, where Sir John asked me to meet him.", "On my arrival, Sir John said that we were meeting at the house because the prime minister was at Kirribilli House (adjacent to Admiralty House) and he (Sir John) did not want the prime minister to know of our meeting.", "That first conversation was in the late morning or early in the afternoon but I am confident that it was not in the late afternoon, as Sir John states.", "The second conversation, which was fairly brief, took place at Admiralty House before and at the end of dinner with Sir John and Lady Kerr that evening.", "My wife and I were the only guests.", "20.", "The substance of the first conversation began with a statement by Sir John in which he said that, after careful consideration of all that happened he had decided that he had no alternative but to dismiss Mr Whitlam and to commission Mr Fraser to form a caretaker government.", "He said he had information from the Electoral Commission that if an election was to be conducted and completed before the Christmas vacation, it had to be held on December 13.", "To enable such an election to take place instructions for it must be given no later than the next Wednesday.", "Sir John then handed me two opinions.", "The first was the \u201cDraft\u201d Opinion by the Law Officers; the second was the solicitor-general\u2019s opinion on alternative financing.", "Neither opinion was sent to me in advance, as the archival documents state.", "21.", "I then read the \u201cDraft\u201d Opinion and simply said \u201cI don\u2019t agree with it\u201d.", "Sir John said \u201cWill you give a written opinion to that effect that I can rely on?\u201d  I replied \u201cI could not do that without consulting Barwick\u201d.", "I also said that it would not be appropriate for me rather than the chief justice to give such a written opinion.", "Sir John then said \u201cWell, I will ask Barwick.\u201d 22.", "After I read the Opinion on alternative financing, I said that I was not prepared to express a view as to its legal efficacy, but went on to say that I thought that the private banks would be unlikely to act on it.", "Sir John then left the room and telephoned the chief justice and was told that he was not in but would be available later in the day.", "I had no discussion with Sir John then or later about what he would or would not say to the chief justice.", "23.", "At the end of our first conversation I expressed my relief that Sir John had made a final decision to resolve the crisis by dismissing the prime minister because I thought that the crisis should be resolved by a general election to be held before the summer vacation and any further delay could lead to instability.", "I do not think that I expressed to Sir John the reason for my relief.", "I assumed that this reason lay behind Sir John\u2019s announced decision to terminate the prime minister\u2019s commission because that decision would facilitate the holding of a general election before the vacation.", "My comment was not, and should not have been understood as, encouragement to dismiss the prime minister as Sir John had already announced his decision to take that step.", "24.", "As I was about to leave I said to Sir John that unfortunately it was unfolding like a Greek tragedy whereupon he called out to Lady Kerr who was upstairs and asked her to join us.", "He explained to her what he had decided to do.", "When I said that the decision was bound to be controversial and attract strong criticism, he said \u201cTony, you don\u2019t know these people.", "I do.", "It will be much worse than you think\u201d.", "It was then that he invited my wife and me to dinner that evening.", "25.", "On our arrival at Admiralty House in the evening, in response to my inquiry, Sir John told me that the prime minister had left Kirribilli House earlier in the day.", "Sir John also said that he had spoken to the chief justice and would be seeing him the next morning.", "Later, at the end of dinner, Sir John told me that he would see Mr Whitlam and simply hand him a letter of dismissal.", "I then said that before doing so he should say that he had no alternative but to dismiss the prime minister unless he was willing to hold a general election.", "26.", "Sir John replied \u201cI know that\u201d.", "I told him that, if he did not warn the prime minister, he would run the risk that people would accuse him of being deceptive.", "I also said that he would need to consider the possibility that the prime minister might ask for time to consider his position and, if so, what response should be made.", "27.", "Sir John made no comment but immediately asked me if I would draft a letter terminating the prime minister\u2019s commission which I agreed to do.", "The draft was delivered early the next morning at Admiralty House.", "The draft was short, consisting of about three sentences, identifying the failure to obtain supply as the critical event.", "The actual letter of dismissal was in very different terms.", "Sir John did not ask me to draft paragraphs for inclusion in his statement of decision.", "I played no part at all in its preparation.", "Nor was it ever shown to me or its contents discussed with me.", "Some time later Sir John returned the draft to me.", "28.", "In the course of the conversation which took place after dinner on November 9, I said to Sir John that he would be criticised for not telling the prime minister that he (Sir John) was disregarding his instruction not to consult the chief justice.", "Sir John said that Barwick\u2019s attendance at Admiralty House the next day would appear in the vice-regal notes and that would constitute sufficient notice to the prime minister.", "29.", "Late on Monday 10 November 1975 Sir John telephoned me to ask whether the Chief Justice had discussed with me the advice he (Sir John) had received from the chief justice.", "I said that the Chief Justice had shown me the letter and I had replied \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d.", "I also said to Sir John Kerr that I would have expressed the advice in slightly different terms but that was not a matter of importance.", "Sir John  said that he had asked the Chief Justice to speak to me because he (Sir John) felt embarrassed that he had first discussed the question with me and he wanted the chief justice to know what my view was.", "30.", "On 11 November 1975 Sir John telephoned me to say that the speaker and others wished to see him to present a resolution of the House of Representatives expressing no confidence in the Fraser government.", "I said that the resolution was irrelevant as he had commissioned Mr Fraser to form a caretaker government for limited purposes to hold a general election.", "31.", "On 19 November or thereabouts I had dinner at Yarralumla with Sir John and Lady Kerr \u2013 I may have stayed there overnight.", "After dinner Sir John said to me that our discussions should be made public for the sake of history and he reminded me that (in our first conversation on November 9) I had expressed my relief that he had decided to dismiss Mr Whitlam.", "I replied by saying that if he were to publish our discussions he would need to record that I had said that he should warn the prime minister and give him the option of calling a general election.", "Sir John made no reply and the conversation turned to other matters.", "On that occasion Sir John spoke of leaving a letter with his executors giving them instructions as to publication.", "32.", "Some years later at a function at The Quarterdeck, Sir John and Lady Kerr\u2019s apartment in Kirribilli, I had another conversation with Sir John about publication of our discussions, a conversation initiated by Sir John.", "It was in terms virtually identical with the discussion in the preceding paragraph, except that there was no reference to instructions to his executors.", "The conversation terminated after my reference to the need to record my remarks about warning the prime minister.", "33.", "In his writings since 9November 1975, Sir John has strongly defended his decision not to warn Mr Whitlam.", "Although he did not discuss his reasons for that decision with me before or after the dismissal, my impression is that Sir John thought that warning the prime minister might lead to Her Majesty becoming embroiled in the Australian constitutional controversy and that he wanted to avoid such an outcome.", "34.", "Despite my disagreement with Sir John\u2019s account of events and his decision not to warn the Prime Minister, I consider that Sir John was subjected to unjustified vilification for making the decision which he made.", "I consider and have always considered that Sir John acted consistently with his duty except in so far as he had a duty to warn the Prime Minister of his intended action and he did not do so.", "You Might Be Interested In These Mason: The Third Man In Whitlam\u2019s Downfall Ellicott Says The Governor-General Will Have To Dismiss Whitlam If Supply Is Blocked"], "context": ["Mason

Chris: Most of your early years at Capcom were spent composing fighting games.", "How did you find adapting to this genre on your original roles on Vampire Savior 2 and Vampire Hunter 2?", "What do you feel you brought to these scores compared to previous composers for the series?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Those Darkstalker games were mostly targeted for Arcade machines.", "There were so many limitations to compose the music for them.", "Because of the specifications of the specific machines, we were especially restricted by the absolute number of voices.", "We also couldn't get as much memory for each instrument as we estimated.", "I felt so much stress due to those limitations back then.", "As a result, I had to adapt to a way of composing that did not use so many voices at first, rather than elaborating upon the genre of the music.", "Of course, I had to learn the compostion approaches of previous composers in the series and I thought it was really good study for me.", "Chris: Marvel vs Capcom 2 and Street Fighter Zero 3 certainly seem to be more experimental and controversial scores than most of their predecessors.", "Would you agree with this assessment?", "Looking back, do you think the approaches were the right ones or would you have taken a different direction if you were in charge?", "Tetsuya Shibata: I agree with your opinion.", "On Marvel vs Capcom 2, it was free to compose in any genre, so I could easily make a change from previous instalments.", "As for Street Fighter Zero 3, there were kind of limitations in terms of musical style.", "The sound director Takayuki Iwai decided the genre, so we needed to compose closely to his vision.", "Nevertheless, I think his direction was the right one.", "Of course, if I could decide the genre, I would lead the music to the different direction.", "I think it is just simply a difference of musicianship.", "Chris: The soundtracks for the Power Stone series certainly reflected your versatility as a composer.", "Was this demanded because of stage-focused format of the score in contrast to the character-focused approach of your earlier Capcom scores?", "Were you already familiar with the styles you incorporated or was there some musical exploration on your part?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Yes, it was the demanded way of scoring.", "The game director told me to compose simple melodies while creating stage-focused music.", "However, I always undergo a period of musical exploration when I start to compose for each title too and tried to reflect some of these discoveries while creating the stage music.", "The jazzy arrangement at the start of the Power Stone Original Soundtrack was a particular diversion for me!", "Chris: Heavy Metal: Geomatrix was the first time that the Capcom Sound Team attempted a heavy metal score.", "How was it to single-handedly compose this project?", "Were you initially comfortable working in the genre or did it require a lot of exploration?", "Tetsuya Shibata: On this project, the producer actually maintained a contract with some oversea rock bands.", "However, I still composed for part of the game.", "As for the heavy metal genre, I used to play guitar and bass with my own band, and we mainly played that genre.", "I therefore had a background as a rocker, so it actually didn't require much exploration.", "Chris: While your works are well-represented on CD, several of your scores such as Marvel vs Capcom 2, Power Stone 2, and Heavy Metal: Geomatrix have never been released.", "Given you have worked closely with Suleputer in the past, could you tell us more about the process of album production and what determines whether a score is released?", "Do you have any regrets these soundtracks didn't make it to CD?", "Tetsuya Shibata: While Suleputer tries to release albums for most Capcom titles, there are some reasons for the unreleased soundtracks.", "First of all, Suleputer basically doesn't release CDs if the game is based on the licensed characters, such as Marvel and Heavy Metal.", "It might cost extra budget, so it can be difficult for Capcom to benefit.", "Power Stone 2 was not released because of the different reason.", "The total sales of the game was not estimated a huge, so it was risky to actually release a soundtrack.", "That's why, but I don't have any regrets, because the reasons were quite simple.", "Chris: On Auto Modellista, you crafted a hard-edged rhythmically-focused fusion score.", "Could you discuss more on why and how you developed this approach?", "Was it liberating to at last principally work with the PlayStation 2 instead of Arcade machines on this project?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Since the game was for PlayStation 2, there were no technical limitations while composing compared with for arcade machines.", "Actually, I wanted to compose with the genres of jazz, club, fusion, or something similar.", "However, the producer asked me to compose the rock music, and I told him it was too straight to express the experience of racing.", "Besides, Sony had already taken the genre of rock music centre-stage with the Gran Turismo series.", "So I decided to blend the two genres \u2014 rock and jazz music \u2014 to create something unique and fitting.", "Chris: Following these works, you also created some more more subtle atmospheric themes for Resident Evil: Outbreak and Devil May Cry 2.", "Could you discuss the unique challenges of these projects and how you overcame them?", "Why do you think more mature projects like these became your main focus in your subsequent years at Capcom?", "Tetsuya Shibata: When I started working on these projects, I was actually fighting with a producer who came from another company.", "He was so pushy then, but I told him that the genres of the music I showed him would absolutely match the games.", "I had no hesitation to tell him my thoughts.", "And he finally trusted me, and told me to take care of these whole titles as a sound director.", "From then onwards, he kept on trusting me and I took on new challenges on the games he produced.", "He is really talented producer, so now I'm having a chance to work with him again despite the fact we have both left Capcom.", "Chris: On that note, Devil May Cry 3 certainly was an impressive achievement in terms of in-game scoring.", "What inspired the decision to take an even more minimalistic approach to most of the setting themes on this project?", "And how did you accomplish the detailed cinematic underscoring on the project?", "Tetsuya Shibata: I really think that game scores should be composed to be a cohesive whole.", "This is particularly where a game contains a story and the composer should watch the whole of it.", "In this regard, there are many parallels with creating film music, but on a larger scale.", "For example, I composed over 140 scores for Devil May Cry 3, but ensured that the music came together as one.", "We composers need to understand the core of the game we're composing, including the story, and then reflect that in the music.", "Chris: While game music fans generally demand complete soundtracks, I've sometimes felt the abundance of subsidiary themes in Capcom soundtracks can be detrimental for stand-alone listening.", "I guess examples would be the abundance of ending themes on Star Gladiator 2, the numerous cinematic event themes on Devil May Cry 3, or certain themes in the Breath of Fire box set.", "Given your involvement in such projects, do you have any personal thoughts on this phenomenon?", "Should soundtracks always be complete or can it be desirable to omit tracks not intended for stand-alone listening?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Oh, this is difficult question.", "I think composers should make a choice of what they consider to be their best tracks.", "Subsequently the company should release both the whole album and the best album.", "However, it depends on the budget \u2014 sometimes it costs much to release two albums.", "However, most fans of the game or soundtrack collectors demand the full soundtracks.", "For example, the original soundtracks for the Breath of Fire series featured most of the best music from the games, but fans complained that it didn't feature all of it.", "So Capcom decided to include the entire music for the series on the Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box basically and I was responsible for bringing it all together.", "Chris: One of the biggest changes in Devil May Cry 3 was the use of heavy metal vocals.", "What inspired this transition after the instrumental rock and electronic approaches of earlier battle themes in the series?", "How did you elaborate even further on this approach on Devil May Cry 4?", "Tetsuya Shibata: I think the power of lyrics and vocals are huge in general.", "That's partly why I tried to include vocals for the music of Devil May Cry 3, both in certain battle tracks and the ending themes.", "In addition, such approaches makes it even easier to tell the theme of the game to the players.", "On Devil May Cry 4, I wanted to explicitly reflect those themes as well, but also included some new innovations with the operatic opener and some of the classic remixes.", "Chris: As sound director on Dead Rising, you also oversaw the use of a number of licensed songs.", "What resulted in the decision to use licensed vocal themes on this project instead of in-house compositions like in Devil May Cry and how did you select the artists?", "Do you think this approach added to the mainstream appeal of the game and do you anticipate a similar approach on the sequel?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Actually I was not technically the sound director on Dead Rising.", "Rather I was kind of sound producer on this title.", "The sound director asked me to find the way to collaborate with rock bands.", "So I asked Kikuchi-san who worked for Sony Music Publishing to explore the way forward and eventually we were able to collaborate with their artists.", "I think this idea matched the image of the game well, so Capcom may want to take the same approach on the sequel.", "Chris: As senior sound director of Resident Evil 5 and Monster Hunter 3, you also organised material to be recorded by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra and FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague.", "What do you think a full orchestra brought to these scores?", "Why did you choose to use orchestras in the West as opposed to stick to Japanese orchestras like the original Monster Hunter?", "Tetsuya Shibata: I just ensured the atmosphere each orchestra created matched the games.", "Resident Evil is well known even as a Hollywood film franchise, so I thought it would match Hollywood-styled orchestra well.", "I wanted have a certain heat to the game's sound that would match a title as huge and monstrous as Resident Evil.", "On Monster Hunter 3, I thought the view of the world of this title needed the traditional kind of European taste, not the Hollywood one.", "On both titles, I didn't stick to Japanese orchestras simply because of the number of musicians required.", "There are no huge studios in Japan like Hollywood or even Prague.", "So I decided to record the orchestra overseas.", "Chris: On the topic of Monster Hunter, you have had a major role on this series since its debut.", "As sound director for the series, how did you influence the approach of the music and sound design on each game?", "What resulted in your decision to only actually compose for the first installment?", "Tetsuya Shibata: The most important thing was for me to find the direction of the music.", "I selected the genre for this game so carefully.", "Of course, I had very frequent discussions with the lead sound designer.", "Then we made the view of the world on this game step-by-step.", "Now I think about it, if you want to design the sound or the music for the game, you need to watch not only individual parts of it, but the whole of the game and the sound.", "It was less important for me to create individual compositions and instead other composers like Masato Kouda usually handled this.", "The role of \"Sound Director\" instead made me oversee the whole.", "Chris: The Monster Hunter series was recently commemorated with a major orchestral concert.", "Did you have any involvement with this event?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Yes!", "I actually planned and produced the show.", "2009 was the fifth anniversary year of the hugely successful series, so I wanted to do something huge.", "As a result, I decided to create an orchestra concert.", "To ensure the success of the concert, I considered the budget at first, and I promised the company that I would make the concert commercially worthwhile.", "Of course, the concert should be for the fans, so I made the best effort for the show.", "This was my last job at Capcom.", "Chris: While the head of the Capcom Sound Team, it seems that you mainly had managerial responsibilities and little time for compositions.", "Aside from Devil May Cry 4's major themes, did you compose any other pieces during this period?", "Was this restriction in composing time one of the major reasons you decided to leave Capcom?", "Tetsuya Shibata: Actually I couldn't find enough time for composing.", "I was not going to compose for the Devil May Cry 4, but the director asked me to compose some main themes.", "So I could found the time only on holidays.", "Lack of composing time didn't make me leave Capcom actually.", "I just wanted to be independent from any companies.", "Now I can do everything by my own

thorough gene flow study under commercial conditions where the GE field was adjacent to non-GE field.", "In non-GE papaya fields separated from GE field by a 12 foot road, the rate of gene flow to the non-GE papaya row that bordered the road was about one percent.", "Further in the field we did not detect any gene flow.", "The bottom line is the pollen flow can occur, but it is very low."], ["In my opinion, we absolutely expected gene flow to occur, the very low rate likely due to the fact that commercial papaya in Hawaii is hermaphrodite (flower has male and female parts) such that the flowers are largely self-pollinated at the time it is opened."], ["Hybridization of the GE papaya to non-GE papaya will not pose any human health problems.", "We have thoroughly studied the potential health

the GE papaya will have on humans and the environment?"], ["The transgenic papaya has been grown commercially in Hawaii since 1998 and there has been no impact of human safety and the environment.",

 attraction was.", "I knew...sex was what it  was...'"], ["I suspect that even if it is not a majority  experience, such a phase among working  class girls is quite common, driven by a  complex

obvious  reasons, from parents, or school and the  authorities.", "It therefore remains largely  unrecorded and unrepresented.", "Films and  novels have occasionally visited the territory,  but not, until now, the elevated world  of fine art."], ["Emin's treatment of this experience appears  simple--a plain rendering of the facts--but  it is in fact quite complex and nuanced.", "In  Dancer she defends herself against the  charge of being a 'slag' and records her  conviction at the time that she was 'better  than all those boys'.", "But in Masculinity she  writes that she 'developed the ridiculous  habit of sleeping with men much older  than me'.", "She also claims that her promiscuous  phase was very 'educational' in an  interview for The South Bank Show.", "This  'ambivalence' towards her sexual experiences  runs throughout her work."], ["Emin records many bad sexual experiences  in her art but she does not 'aestheticise'  them.", "She deals with childhood abuse,  humiliation, abandonment, rape and abortion  in the way these things actually happen  to women (never as her own or others'  fantasy material) and with the severe emotional  trauma and pain they caused.", "There  is no romanticisation of abjection."], ["This central theme is held in tension with  two others.", "The first is that her experiences,  though often bad, have not proved insuperable.", "Yes, they were deeply painful but they  were not, including the rape, 'unspeakable'  or 'the worst thing imaginable'.", "She does  not revel in her suffering, only in her ability  to have overcome it.", "Why I Never Became A  Dancer ends with a seagull soaring up and  away from the shores of Margate."], ["The second is the retention, despite the  traumas of the past, of an open, affirmative  attitude to sex and sexuality:"], ["'You don't fuck me over/You gently lift  me out of bed/Lay me on the floor/And  make love to me'2"], ["Holding these three elements, each of  them a humane and progressive response,  in tension with each other but without  allowing any of them to be compromised,  is a very considerable artistic and emotional  achievement."], ["Emin does not present herself as a feminist  artist and is not generally thought of as  one.", "But, in dealing with sex Emin deals  also with sexism.", "Why I Never Became A  Dancer confronts the--very crude--sexism  rampant among certain teenage boys and  young men.", "My Bed challenges the sexist  attitude that makes a disordered bedroom  much more shameful for a woman than a  man.", "Indeed there is a sense in which the  totality of her art practice and persona  challenge the double standards about sex."], ["The question of class interacts with the  question of sexism here.", "Emin is not seen  as a 'feminist' artist because feminism and,  especially, feminism in the art world has  been a largely middle class phenomenon,  focusing mainly on the issues that concern  middle class and professional women: especially  how women are represented in the  media, literature, art, etc.", "The issues Emin  deals with--how teenage girls get 'slagged  off' and 'broken into'--are not recognised  as feminist because they come from a different  world.", "But the fact is that Emin  tackles sexism at the sharp end."], ["Art: 'I Need Art Like I Need God', is the  title and content of one of Emin's pieces in  neon lighting, and 'art', in particular  Emin's relationship to art, is a central  theme in her work."], ["One of the ways 'art' features in Emin's  work is through her references to other  artists.", "Of course many artists do this, but  Emin's range of reference is broad and  impressive (which gives the lie to another  of the myths about her, namely that she is  some kind of 'primitive' or 'naif')."], ["Most obviously she is indebted to her hero  Edvard Munch, and to Egon Schiele.", "The  use of language in both the monoprints and  the blankets nods to Basquiat; the neon  lighting pieces are influenced by Don Flavin  and Bruce Naumann; My Bed recalls  Rauschenberg's Bed and, more subtly, the  bed of Manet's Olympia; The Helter Skelter  construction references the Tatlin tower; the  blanket work in general builds on the use of  sewing and textiles by feminist artists of the  1970s and 1980s."], ["Of course if quoting other artists was the  main point of these works it would make  them banal, but with Emin's pieces this is  not the case.", "Her principal tribute to  Munch is Homage to Edvard Munch and All  my Dead Children and is accompanied by  her verbal scream which is truly disturbing  and terrible.", "Her drawings may owe something  to Schiele but are in no way  imitations or similar in content.", "In the case  of the blanket work Emin has transformed  the genre, freeing it of its craft and genteel  associations, and making it into vibrant  new form in its own right."], ["As we know from Marx, in class societies  the ruling class invariably (if not completely)  dominates the culture.", "However  the domination in the field of visual art  has been more complete, more extreme  than in other art forms.", "This is because  whereas the poet or novelist needs only  pen and paper, visual art must be  embodied in materials (which are very  expensive), stored, and exhibited, either in  museums and galleries or in public places  (which of course are never controlled by  the public).", "And because in the capitalist  epoch the art market has focused on the  buying and selling of 'unique' and 'original'  works, in contrast to music and  literature, which centre on either the  large-scale selling of mechanical reproductions-- books, CDs, etc--or live performances  to collective audiences."], ["As a result, from Tutankhamun to Lorenzo  de Medici and Henry VIII to Rockefeller  and Saatchi, visual art has been dominated  by the very rich and very powerful.", "This in  turn has meant that the exclusion and marginalisation  of working class people,  women and black people has been even  more marked in visual art than in other art  forms.", "There is no female painter whose  standing compares with Jane Austen or  George Eliot and not a single painting by a  black artist in the National Gallery.", "In this  context the work of Tracey Emin is both  an example of limited change that has  occurred and a challenge to the present  and the future.3"], ["Marx also tells us that art, like religion,  philosophy and politics, is part of the  superstructure of society, which arises from  and is conditioned by the economic base.", "I  would add that the economic base, that is,  the forces and relations of production,  gives rise to and shapes a developing  ensemble of social relations which range  from how people dress, to family and  sexual relations, to how people look at a  king or a beggar and how a king or a  beggar looks at the people, to how we  experience the sea, the countryside and the  city."], ["What major art does is express and comment  upon these changing social relations in a  visually powerful way.", "Giotto and Brueghel,  Hals and Rembrandt, Hogarth and Goya,  Courbet, Picasso and Warhol all do this in  their differing ways.", "And so does Emin."], ["The changing social relations that Emin  addresses are those shaping the relative  positions in society of women and men,  especially young working class women and  men.", "The changes in this sphere in the  course the last half century or so have been  spectacular: the huge rise in the number of  women (especially married women) in  paid labour, the Equal Pay Act, the Sex  Discrimination Act, the pill, legalised abortion,  freer divorce and lip service to  equality all over the place."], ["In other ways they remain strictly limited:  no fundamental change in the division of  labour in the home, no equal pay in reality,  women still hugely underrepresented in  top jobs, sexist images all over the media.", "Of course the change is not evenly spread  across society.", "In my judgement the least  has been at the very top among those who  own the wealth and control the state.", "There, bourgeois male power remains  firmly entrenched.", "The biggest change has  been among the professional middle  classes--academics, intellectuals, media  people, etc--where the success of girls in  education and higher education has had its  effect and equal opportunities policies  abound."], ["Many working class women have also benefited  from the changes, from the shift in  general attitudes and the increased educational  and job opportunities.", "But for the  majority, especially in the manual as  opposed to white collar working class,  where money for child care is scarce or  nonexistent and the struggle for survival  dominates, the change has been minimal.", "Some working class men, in the main the  politically more progressive, have changed  their attitudes, but many have not and the  old sexism remains rampant.", "The problems  are particularly acute among teenagers and  young men anxious to establish their  virility, and this is what working class girls  and young women have to cope with."], ["These are the contradictions which Emin  has lived and which her art expresses and  responds to with clarity and passion.", "Politically there is an obvious problem in  that while Emin's work ultimately carries a  message of hope, it is hope for an individual  not a collective or social solution,  and this can only be possible for a small  minority.", "Unfortunately we don't get our  art to political order and given the historical  period of Emin's artistic formation, the  1980s and early 1990s, it is hardly surprising  that collective working class  emancipation through political action was  not high on her agenda.", "What matters  more than the correct politics is whether  the problems addressed are real, whether  the art has integrity and whether it is visually  imaginative and powerful.", "Emin's work  succeeds on all these counts with the extra  factor that it really speaks to people, and  people beyond the normal range of 'art  lovers', in a way that is achieved by no  other contemporary artist."]], "context": ["John Molyneux explains in his article Emin Matters, that her work revolves around class, sex and art itself.", "He writes that, \"What she does do is

Artificial Hive Mind Knows The AnswerAfter tweeting a request for ideas about how he should direct his future philanthropy, a company that specializes in harnessing the wisdom of crowds used their

Mike Kane/Bloomberg/Getty Images]"], ["With a net worth of $86 billion, Jeff Bezos certainly has enough money to change the world.", "What he's lacked, apparently, was some direction for how to spend it.", "In mid-June, the Amazon founder tweeted a \"request for ideas\" worth philanthropically investing in that would help society, both short-term-\"here and now\"-and in the long run, as he put it: \"at the \"intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.", "\"That question generated more than 46,000 responses on Twitter, leaving Bezos with another issue.", "How to sort and weigh all that feedback?", "Louis Rosenberg, the founder of Silicon Valley-based Unanimous AI had an answer, and decided to show it off using Bezos's responses.", "Rosenberg and his company specialize in a form of advanced decision making called swarm intelligence, basically a computer-enhanced way to get humans to communicate like honeybees do in nature, by tapping into the experiences of large groups of individuals to make the most complete community decision possible.", "In the name of social progress-and certainly some self-promotion-Rosenberg turned his tech on Bezos's information-overload problem.", "It took some tricky methodology and lots of processing power inside a customized platform, but the result was rather surprising.", "Turns out, Americans feel most strongly about things like cancer treatment assistance, cheaper medicine, and mobile health clinics.Some of those things might be personally driven: It seems like everyone knows someone whose life has been touched by cancer, and huge swaths of America don't have affordable access to healthcare or decent nearby services.", "Ultimately, however Rosenberg's simulated swarm unanimously picked a basic and fundamental issue for Bezos to focus on: universal access to clean drinking water.It's the universality of that issue that Rosenberg finds interesting.", "While concerns about water safety continue to grow in the U.S. (lead contamination likely goes far beyond Flint, Michigan), access to safe, readily available water remains a critical issue in the developing world, as well.", "\"A swarm by their very nature encourages a group to find the places where they agree,\" says Rosenberg.", "\"And as a result they tend to find the solutions that are best for the greater good as opposed to forming factions that are defending their own interests.\"", "More data shows that nearly everyone ended up happy and confident in that answer.Most artificial intelligence systems set out to mimic and improve neurological intelligence, using sets of algorithms and machine learning to solve challenges with more processing power at greater speeds than humans are capable.", "That's prompted fears (and a well-known movie franchise) about sentient beings becoming self-aware.Despite its sci-fi sounding name, though, an artificial hive mind keeps humans at the center of each transaction.", "\"Instead of just being a system of neurons where intelligence emerges,\" says Rosenberg, \"swarm intelligence is a system of organisms where super intelligence emerges.", "\"Take bees, for instance.", "Individually, they aren't very smart.", "But bees don't think on their own when it comes to important decisions.", "Instead, each bee shares what information it has about a certain scenario through vibrations with the group, allowing the swarm to decide, in real time, based on lots of feedback, what action might be best for collective survival.Same goes for birds that flock, fish that school, and ants that assemble into colonies.", "\"They're smarter together,\" Rosenberg says.", "\"It's about enabling groups of organisms to be connected in real time with feedback loops so that they can converge on optimal solutions and they can basically amplify their intelligence.", "\"Unanimous's technology mimics that process, using a platform called Unu, an online community managed by the company that works a lot like a virtual Ouija board.", "It generally asks one question, with six answers arranged at different points around a hexagonal ring.", "In the center of the ring there is a translucent, circular puck, which online participants on the company's platform can tug with their cursor toward whatever answer they deem the best.Those people may be located all over the U.S., but each cursor is represented on a shared screen by a tiny magnet icon, so that as the puck moves toward one answer or another, those within the swarm can see where the decision might be headed, and where others are trying to pull it.", "If there's another solution they might prefer to the pending outcome that seems to also have a lot of support, they can shift their alliance, tugging the puck in that direction.Since it was launched in 2015, Unanimous AI has used its \"wisdom of crowds\" process most for easily quantifiable problem solving: In 2016, its \"Swarm AI\" process predicted far more Oscar winners (11 of 15 categories) than polled moviegoers or even top critics.", "It has also beaten legions of traditional gamblers when placing Vegas-style bets on the Super Bowl (68% of all prop bets paid off).", "In fact, one month before Bezos's charity advice tweet, Unanimous AI correctly called the top four finishers in the Kentucky Derby for an extremely rare superfecta, turning Rosenberg's promotional $20 bet into about $11,000.In swarming, the options always max out at six to avoid confusion known as \"choice overload.\"", "Twitter didn't cough up six ideas though-it offered tens of thousands.To vet the submissions, Unanimous created a simple language filter, grouping repetitive ideas that shared similar themes into a smaller set of 200 different suggestions.", "Next, the group asked 300 volunteers to grade each idea on a scale of 1 to 10, based on Bezos's critera.", "Proposals with a cumulative average of at least 7 or higher moved on for final consideration leaving a field of 25 potential solutions.From there, Unanimous began a process of elimination game inside their platform.", "They asked 100 users on Unu to review the 25 remaining ideas in batches of 6, tugging the puck toward whichever the community thought would be least helpful.", "The system deleted the loser, reshuffled the five survivors, and began the process of elimination again, until, eventually, the pool was reduce to six finalists: cancer treatment assistance, universal access to clean drinking water, mobile health clinics, free medicine for the poor, essential equipment for rural hospitals, and health clinics for the poor.Once the six finalists were chosen, Unu offered a direct question to the swarm: \"Which should we recommend Bezos focus his philanthropy?\"", "The swarm took about 10 seconds to tug the puck toward their decision: universal access to clean drinking water.As you can see in the animation below, water equality wasn't necessarily everyone's first choice, but as the puck began to move, it became far favorable than some others on the board, which lead to an acceptable group decision.Afterward, Unanimous generated a factional analysis to highlight how allegiances shifted during the tug of war.", "Nearly everyone appears to have quickly reconciled that clean water was important.", "Based on some internal math that accounts the zigs-and-zags, Unanimous estimates that the swarm is 85% confident in its answer.To ensure that the decision met all of Bezos's criteria, Rosenberg rephrased that question and ran other swarms, focusing specifically on which solution might be the most urgent, have lasting impact, and affect the most people.", "Each time, though, drinking water topped out.The swarm's decision for Bezos to tackle water rights, perhaps against its own immediate self-interest for cheaper meds or a cancer breakthrough, parallels research that shows how swarms often perform far better than disconnected individuals in \"tragedy of the commons\" scenarios, which tempt people to take more than a fair share of some potential community windfall, with the risk that if too many people get greedy everyone might get nothing.In second place is health clinics for the poor, followed by free medicine for the poor, and then cancer treatment assistance.", "Further down, concepts like a free online university, providing glasses to poor children, legal help for domestic abuse victims, purchasing drug patents to lower costs, and \"earn while learning\" jobs programs all made the list.Whether Bezos is actually taking the responses to his tweet to heart remains to be seen, but if it was an attempt at coming to some sort of democratic decisions about his future philanthropy, he now has his answer."]], "context": ["In 2014, he founded Unanimous

Cruz's unconventional ways and personal touch, the faculty on Monday rejected a proposal to end the requirement that professors write paragraph-long evaluations of each student in class.", "The faculty already has agreed to institute mandatory grades, beginning next fall.", "Students and alumni worried that eliminating written performance evaluations, on top of starting to use A-F letter grades, would rob the campus of a distinct spirit that fosters learning for learning's sake.Until now, most students have taken courses on a pass/not pass basis, relying on the narratives to give them more precise feedback.Santa Cruz was a rare place, they said, where students asked professors about the subject matter, not what's heard most frequently on other campuses: \"Will this be on the final exam?", "\"Ending written evaluations, students argued, would have removed another distinction: the need for professors to get to know their students--at least well enough to write short narratives about them.", "\"Only UCSC was gifted with the nongrading system,\" a 1970 graduate recently wrote.", "\"Otherwise, UCSC is just another cookie-cutter college that happens to be surrounded with redwoods.", "\"Professors advocating the status quo prevailed Monday in a voice vote of the faculty's governing body, the Academic Senate.", "That vote could be appealed to a vote-by-mail of the senate's full membership of 600 professors, if the full senate chooses.", "\"The policy remains the same,\" said campus spokeswoman Elizabeth Irwin.", "\"It was not a close vote.", "\"But the senate restated that the professors have wide leeway to determine what's covered in the evaluations.", "It also called for reformatting transcripts to make them shorter and getting professors more technological help.Such written evaluations, said linguistics professor Bill Ladusaw, \"needn't be a massive task.", "There are lots of ways of automating these things.", "\"A growing number of faculty members have complained that the narratives have become an onerous chore as the campus has grown from a cozy alternative college of 5,000 students to a burgeoning research university expected to soon enroll 15,000 students.What makes the system more burdensome, the professors argue, is that besides nearly tripling the size of the student body, the student-faculty ratio has more than doubled--from 9-1 to nearly 19-1.It's difficult to get to know more than a handful of students in a big lecture class, some professors say.They say narrative evaluations, often written by teaching assistants, have become formulaic, paragraphs of boilerplate language that correspond to a particular grade.", "\"We believe the faculty's time is better spent by focusing on the letters of recommendations rather than writing evaluations for each student,\" wrote Manfred Warmuth, a computer scientist, and Maria Schonbek, a mathematician.But other professors, adherents to Santa Cruz's tradition, prevailed by arguing that even boilerplate evaluations are better than impersonal grades.", "\"The people in chemistry who give students a table showing their quiz average, their attendance and whether their work has improved or dived during the quarter have been more informative than a grade,\" Ladusaw said.Furthermore, the narratives say whether a student did better than average in class--a distinction lost at many colleges as rampant grade inflation has made Bs, and even A's, the most common grades.The desire to preserve evaluations was echoed by UC Santa Cruz students who demonstrated Monday as the school's Academic Senate discussed the future of the evaluations.", "One student carried a sign proclaiming: \"I came to UCSC because of the EVALS!!", "\"The alumni weighed in too, calling professors and writing letters.", "\"I understand the university is not a museum frozen in time,\" said Stephen Klein, a 1972 graduate who runs 19 libraries for Los Angeles County.", "\"But I think there are values that are key to why the place is different and important for students who are looking for something other than the massive, impersonal classes of Berkeley or UCLA.\""]], "context": ["Schonbek joined the University of California, Santa Cruz faculty in 1986.", "Formerly a professor of mathematics there, she has retired to become a professor emeritus."],
