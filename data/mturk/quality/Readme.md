This directory has the manual judgments about whether or not a reference documents has supporting evidence for the cloze.
The `judgments` directory has individual batch outputs from Mechanical Turk, and `gold.jsonl` has them post-processed into one file.
The `gold.jsonl` has more judgments than the `judgments` directory because I manually annotated some by hand before setting up the Mechanical Turk task.
The `hitapp.html` is the template used in the annotation task.
