            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this task is to decide whether or not a reference document
                provides <em>supporting evidence</em> for a particular sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a sentence states some information and the provided document also contains
                part or all of that same information, then the document <em>does</em> provide
                supporting evidence (a <b>Yes</b> answer).
                Otherwise, the document <em>does not</em> support the sentence (a <b>No</b> answer).
            </p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Carefully read the input sentence and make sure you understand what it says.
                If necessary, use the provided context to get a better understanding.
                Then, look in the reference document for that same information and make a decision
                based on the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the document provides evidence that the sentence is true, say <b>Yes</b>.</li>
                    <li>If the document does not provide evidence, say <b>No</b>.</li>
                    <li>If the answer is not clear, say <b>Unclear</b>, but please use this option rarely.</li>
                    <li>If there is an error in the task, say <b>Error</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                Only use the document to make your decision. If the context provides supporting
                evidence, ignore it.

                The documents may be very long, so for some tasks, we have provided highlights which may help you find information in the
                document more easily. You may also find using "ctrl-f" (Windows) or "cmd-f" (Mac) to search
                for keywords may help you make your decision faster.

                            Following Russia's banning from the 2018 Winter Olympics and the stripping of medals from multiple Russian athletes, Russian oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov, controlling owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, agreed to finance a defamation lawsuit in New York against Rodchenkov.
                            The suit claims that Rodchenkov defamed three Russian biathletes — Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina — when Rodchenkov included them on a list of athletes who took performance-enhancing drugs as part of a state-controlled program that corrupted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

                            PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — With Russia performing feebly at the Winter Games because many of its best athletes are barred for doping violations, the Russian oligarch who owns the N. B.A.’s Brooklyn Nets is helping to finance an attempt to attack the credibility of the whistle-blower who exposed the country’s elaborate doping program.

                            The oligarch, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, who led Russia’s biathlon federation before and during the 2014 Sochi Games, is backing a long-shot legal effort against the whistle-blower, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that will commence with a defamation lawsuit to be filed in New York State Court on Tuesday.
                            The suit, which The New York Times reviewed before it was filed, claims Dr. Rodchenkov defamed three now-retired Russian biathletes — Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina — when he linked them to the state-controlled scheme that corrupted the last Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.
