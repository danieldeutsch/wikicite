The young Bruce Wayne (Gus Lewis) leads a privileged life as the son of wealthy, philanthropist parents, both of whom stress their commitment to improving the lives of the citizens of crime-ridden Gotham City. After his mother and father are murdered by a mugger, however, Wayne grows into an impudent young man (Christian Bale), full of rage and bent on retribution until encouraged by his childhood sweetheart, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), to search for answers beyond his own personal vendettas. Wayne eventually finds discipline in the Far East under the tutelage of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows who guides him in the study of martial arts -- and the ways in which an ordinary man can hone his senses to an almost superhuman acuity. After seven years away from Gotham, Wayne returns, determined to bring peace and safety back to the city. With the help of his faithful manservant, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine), and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a scientist at his late father's corporation, Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice. But when a shady psychiatrist (Cillian Murphy) joins forces with the criminal underworld, Wayne realizes that putting an end to their nefarious plans will be very difficult indeed. Batman Begins also features Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordon and Tom Wilkinson as the crime boss Carmine Falcone. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</p> <p>PG-13 (for intense action violence, disturbing images and some thematic elements)</p> <p>5 Ways to Get Totally Lost in the New DC Universe</p> <p>New on Netflix in August</p> <p>All 42 Fresh Movies and Originals Coming to Netflix in January</p> <p>Nolan takes an admirable stab at developing a character-driven drama, only to give in to generic action-movie conventions with a blinding, deafening, explosion-laden finale that could have capped off any number of interchangeable Jerry Bruckheimer flicks.</p> <p>Batman Begins summons up moments of great eloquence and power.

PHOTO: FACEBOOK/ GHANA ALI OFFICIAL</p> <p>In a matter of only three years, Ghana Ali has established herself as one of Pakistan's most promising leading ladies in films and on television. She is determined to portray diverse characters in the future, and is also working on two television projects at the moment.</p> <p>Ghana secured a role and got noticed in last year's Rangreza; though not commercially successful, she persevered in the recent comedy, Maan Jao Na. Alongside these developments, the glamorous 24-year-old spoke about her forthcoming film. She hasn't disclosed anything pertinent about it yet, but I will surely dig into it! Till then, let's hear it from Ghana herself.</p> <p>Tell me a bit about Ghana Ali, and what describes you best?</p> <p>I was born and brought up in Lahore. I'm the youngest of five siblings, and have been working in the industry for over three years now. Acting is what I am passionate about. Words such as confident, ambitious and assertive fit me well.</p> <p>You were the star of the comedy film Maan Jao Na. Are you satisfied with the response of the audience and critical reviews?</p> <p>Yes, I'm completely chuffed. I think I did my character justice. When the audience and critics appreciate your work, you know you have done something you had already anticipated.</p> <p>What are your thoughts on Pakistan's media?</p> <p>I think it has come a long way. We have so many options on television, be it news or entertainment, and the competition is getting fierce by the day. PTV is no longer the only medium of news and entertainment. Digital and social media are the next big thing, as they have provided a platform for many young people to start small businesses, and it is great to see them excel in that respect.</p> <p>I always say, 'nothing is bad'. It is how you choose to use something that makes it good or bad. Yes, it can be frustrating at times when you pick up a newspaper or magazine and read something about yourself completely misquoted, but everything has its pros and cons.</p> <p>What characters do you seek to portray in the future?</p> <p>I never imagine myself playing any character. All I look for is a challenge. Any character that gives me the platform to perform will be my ideal role, where I am allowed to showcase my acting skills.</p> <p>It is really important people recognise me for my acting talent, as the sole purpose of me getting into acting was my passion for it.</p> <p>Are you working on anything currently? What specifics can you share?</p> <p>Yes, I am working on a couple of projects. There are two altogether.</p> <p>I am playing the lead character alongside Faisal Qureshi and Aijaz Aslam in the sequel of Kis Din Mera Viyah Howay Ga. My other series, titled Ustani Jee, is with Yasra Rizvi and Hammad Farooqui. It is being directed by Angeline Malik.</p> <p>What one question would you want the media to stop asking celebrities?</p> <p>I would say asking too many questions about one's personal life. I understand that we are in the public eye and people want to know everything about us, but there is a limit to how much you want to share. If someone chooses to be open about it, that is a different story altogether, but probing and investigating someone's personal life unnecessarily is ridiculous.</p> <p>If you could spend money on something you love, what would you spend it on? Why?</p> <p>Shopping, because every woman loves it!</p> <p>Are you more of a foodie or fitness freak?</p> <p>I love food, but the nature of my job demands fitness.</p> <p>I think it is a balancing act. You can still enjoy all your food, as long as you know when to stop.</p> <p>Do you prefer the seaside or the mountains?</p> <p>Are you more social or anti-social?</p> <p>It depends on my mood. But generally, I feel I'm quite social.</p> <p>What is your ultimate guilty pleasure?</p> <p>What message would you like to share with your fans?</p> <p>I love you all dearly. I am who I am today because of your constant love and support, and I want you to know I really appreciate it.</p> <p>Whether it is films or television, Ghana seems to be on the right track. She is already making waves in Pakistan with monumental roles in films, and it surprises many of us that she has accomplished so much in such a short period of time.</p> <p>Evidently, Ghana enjoys acting as much as she loves talking about it. She exudes confidence, and it rightfully shows in her craft. If that is not enough, she also appears unconventional for a typecast Pakistani actress, and knows how to work the camera well.</p> <p>Keep at it, Ghana!</p> <p>The author is a model, actor, talk show host and writer for fashion magazines OK!

While the economic anxiety of Trump supporters is often touted as the driving force behind the mogul's electoral college victory, that rationale is just a ruse, a clever red herring. The median income of a Trump supporter is more than $70,000 per year, which is well above the national average, and a 2016 study noted that it would take African Americans 228 years to equal the wealth of whites in the U. S. Clearly, Trump's pathway into the Oval Office is not really about white economic angst. Rather, Barack Obama's election -- and its powerful symbolism of black advancement -- was the major trigger for the policy backlash that led to Donald Trump, and which has now put America's national security at risk.</p> <p>Republicans carved out this trench shortly after Obama's 2008 victory. The GOP pushed through a number of laws at the state level to block as many of his voters, primarily African Americans, from the polls as possible. North Carolina targeted black voters with nearly ""surgical precision."" Wisconsin Republicans were ""giddy"" about disfranchising African Americans, especially in Milwaukee. Florida's GOP cut particular days of early voting to nullify the political participation of black churchgoers. Texas required certain types of government-issued photo IDs to vote and then ensured that nearly 1.6 million black and Latino citizens would have very limited access. Ohio skewed its early voting laws to diminish the turnout in the cities while also implementing a literacy test that officials applied only to those in urban counties.</p> <p>The end result was that the Republicans had effectively shattered the black and Latino demographic firewall that could have prevented a Trump presidency. A Trump presidency, to be clear, that many in the Republican establishment rightfully feared because of the mogul's demonstrated unfitness for office.</p> <p>But they didn't fear it enough. Because even in the wake of federal court orders striking down many of the most odious, discriminatory features of voter suppression, the GOP resisted, stalled and defied the judiciary until confusion and resignation reigned at the polls. It was too late.</p> <p>In a horrific Faustian calculation, these Republican patriots put the nation at risk so that Trump could fulfill his dominant campaign promise. And, to be clear, it was not to make America great again, but to make access to America's resources ""whites only"" again. The Klan recognized it, as did the white nationalists who gave Trump their full-throttled support. But, this wasn't just a fantasy of the far right. The allure of a revived Jim Crow nation that proudly, willfully excludes and debases millions of nonwhites was so reaffirming and reassuring that everything else became secondary or tertiary. Everything else, including national security.</p> <p>Despite his glaring lack of qualifications, patriots shoved Trump into the role of Commander in Chief -- a man who had already maligned the U. S. military as a ""disaster,"" denigrated the generals dismantling ISIS, and disparaged POWs for being stupid enough to get caught. Patriots cheered on as Trump asked the Russian government to hack an American citizen who had led a national-security agency. Patriots acquiesced to a foreign policy that encouraged nuclear proliferation, oozed profound ignorance about the basic fundamentals of U.S. nuclear capability, and kept in play use of the ultimate weapon by a man who has difficulty even maintaining control on Twitter.</p> <p>Patriots gleefully ignored warnings by the National Security Agency that the hacked documents released by WikiLeaks were actually the result of and washed through Russian intelligence. Patriots didn't blink when Trump's economic plan included the possibility of defaulting on the U. S. debt although that ""could undermine the stability of global financial markets"" on a scale not seen since the Great Recession and cost American taxpayers billions of dollars in higher interest rates. Patriots accepted Trump's admiration of Vladimir Putin, disdain for the President of the United States, and a foreign policy agenda that matched up smoothly with the Russian -- not American -- government's.</p> <p>In other words, in January 2017, a man will be at the helm of the U. S. military, intelligence and foreign policy bureaucracies, who actually encouraged foreign intervention in an American election and advocated for dismantling the alliances that will aid Russian expansionism and weaken U.S. influence and power. Yet, the patriots bet that the trade-off will be well worth it.</p> <p>Clearly, white rage has brought us here.</p>","Yes"

 of P3P development and recommends guidelines regarding the responsible use
 of P3P technology. It is one section of the P3P Implementation Guide. Comments
 to the editor or endorsements are welcome.</p> <p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) has been designed to be
 flexible and support a diverse set of user preferences, public policies,
 service provider polices, and applications. This flexibility will provide
 opportunities for using P3P in a wide variety of innovative ways that its
 designers had not imagined. The P3P Guiding Principles were created in order
 to: express the intentions of the undersigned members of the P3P working
 groups when designing this technology and suggest how P3P can be used most
 effectively in order to maximize privacy and user confidence and trust on
 the Web. In keeping with our goal of flexibility, this document does not
 place requirements upon any party. Rather, it makes recommendations about
 1) what should be done to be consistent with the intentions of the
 P3P designers and 2) how to maximize user confidence in P3P implementations
 and Web services. We invite organizations, individuals, policy-makers, and
 companies who use P3P to join us in supporting these principles.</p> <p>P3P has been designed to promote privacy and trust on the Web by enabling
 service providers to disclose their information practices, and enabling
 individuals to make informed decisions about the collection and use of their
 personal information. P3P user agents work on behalf of individuals to reach
 agreements with service providers about the collection and use of personal
 information. Trust is built upon the mutual understanding that each party
 will respect the agreement reached.</p> <p>Service providers should preserve trust and protect privacy by applying relevant
 laws and principles of data protection and privacy to their information
 practices. The following is a list of privacy principles and guidelines that
 helped inform the development of P3P and may be useful to those who use P3P:</p> <p>CDMA Code of Ethics</p> <p>& Standards of Practice: Protection of Personal Privacy</p> <p>1981</p> <p>Council of Europe Convention For the Protection of Individuals with Regard</p> <p>to Automatic Processing of Personal Data</p> <p>CSA--Q830-96 Model Code for the Protection</p> <p>of Personal Information</p> <p>Directive</p> <p>95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995</p> <p>on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal</p> <p>data and on the free movement of such data</p> <p>The</p> <p>DMA's Marketing Online Privacy Principles & Guidance and the The DMA's</p> <p>Ethical Business Practice Guidelines</p> <p>OECD Guidelines</p> <p>on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data</p> <p>In addition, service providers and P3P implementers should recognize and
 address the special concerns surrounding children's privacy.</p> <p>Service providers should provide timely and effective notices of their
 information practices, and user agents should provide effective tools for
 users to access these notices and make decisions based on them.</p> <p>Service providers should:</p> <p>Communicate explicitly about data collection and use, identifying the purpose</p> <p>for which personal information is collected and the extent to which it may</p> <p>be shared.</p> <p>Use P3P proposals to communicate about all information they propose to collect</p> <p>through a Web interaction.</p> <p>User agents should:</p> <p>Provide users an option that allows them to easily preview and agree to or</p> <p>reject each transfer of personal information that the user agent facilitates.</p> <p>Not be configured by default to transfer personal information to a service</p> <p>provider without the user's consent.</p> <p>Inform users about the privacy-related options offered by the user agent.</p> <p>Users should be given the ability to make meaningful choices about the
 collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Users should retain
 control over their personal information and decide the conditions under which

 fairness and integrity. This is essential for protecting privacy and promoting
 trust.</p> <p>Service providers should:</p> <p>Accurately represent their information practices in a clear and unambiguous</p> <p>manner -- never with the intention of misleading users.</p> <p>Use information only for the stated purpose and retain it only as long as</p> <p>necessary.</p> <p>Ensure that information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</p> <p>User agents should:</p> <p>Act only on behalf of the user according to the preferences specified by</p> <p>the user.</p> <p>While P3P itself does not include security mechanisms, it is intended to

""And then they started getting up and they started following me. And I just ran. Because I didn't know what else to do.</p> <p>""Afterward, I sobbed for about 20 minutes. I just broke down.""</p> <p>Later, though, Wolanin knew exactly what she needed to do. Like many artists, she decided to turn a negative experience into a positive one.</p> <p>She wrote a song about it.</p> <p>The result, ""Never Said No,"" just hit radio stations nationwide this week. The music video has racked up about 18,000 views on YouTube since debuting Dec. 3.</p> <p>The catchy song and video turn the tables on a would-be sexual assailant. A man comes on to Wolanin in a secluded parking garage and tells her ""No doesn't mean no -- if you don't say it loud enough.""</p> <p>So the potential victim does what any woman would do in that situation: She takes the guy back to her apartment, drugs him, ties him up and apparently kills him.</p> <p>Well, he never said ""no,"" either.</p> <p>""It's a total revenge fantasy,"" Wolanin says and smiles. ""I wanted to write a song that was putting the woman in a position of power.""</p> <p>But don't read too much into the song's violence, she says. It's simply taking a sexual assailant's logic to its most extreme point.</p> <p>""It's fictional,"" she says. ""I don't condone violence. It's symbolizing making the aggressor feel like the victim.""</p> <p>Wolanin, 26, hopes the song catches on and gets people talking about the issues of sexual harassment and misogynist song lyrics.</p> <p>""I want to spread the message,"" she says. ""I want to change the culture.""</p> <p>""Never Said No"" is a far cry from Wolanin's best-known music: Christmas songs. Her versions of ""Silver Bells"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"" were both Top 20 hits on the Billboard Adult Contemporary radio charts. Her 2013 song, ""Run Rudolph Run,"" went all the way to No. 2.</p> <p>""It's so dark,"" Wolanin says about ""Never Said No."" ""It's the opposite of 'Frosty the Snowman!'""</p> <p>WATCH THE VIDEO FOR ""NEVER SAID NO""</p>","Yes"

You know, that quick slap plus foot tap rhythm so intrinsically connected to our houses of worship that it seems no one but us can do it or even knows what it's all about.</p> <p>Sir, the son of a Pentecostal preacher, uses this beat to great effect in his song ""Raise Hell."" But you might be remiss if you put him into the category of a traditional gospel artist. Traditional he ain't. He's pushing far too many spiritual buttons for that.</p> <p>""I think I'm the [new] Nat Turner,"" says the 28-year-old Chicago-born vocalist, whose album releases later this year. ""People remember the MLK dream speech but won't talk about the 'I've seen the mountain top' speech. I'm a minister with a gun in my hand and a knife in my mind saying 'we're coming back to take back our community.' Pardon me if I don't sound as politically religious as the other people.</p> <p>He goes on.</p> <p>""If I had to put a category there, it would be two parts: ghetto gospel. I'm the side that people normally don't speak about. You got Jesus that turned the tables over in the church. At this point, he's raising hell. That's why the [album] artwork is a Jesus mugshot. It's just a different vibe.""</p> <p>True that. Sir, who was born William James Stokes, grew up in a strict household and has 22 brothers and sisters. Twenty-two. (Says Sir: ""I think my oldest brother is 60-something and I'm 28. And my dad was a preacher. Put that together."") He's from the Bronzeville neighborhood in Chicago, an area known for its jazz, blues and gospel greats. In fact, gospel is said to have been born in Bronzeville. Sir, the child of ""Christian Apologist Dr. James Benton and Mission Ambassador Patricia Ann,"" draws from that legacy in his writing.</p> <p>His music is not preachy. In fact, he questions authority and raises social action issues in his work. He's got a cut, ""(Creflo) Almighty Dollar,"" with an assist from Twista that will make some churchgoers chuckle as he references Georgia's mega church prosperity pastor who, for better or worse, literally has the word ""money"" in his name. (Here's a smidge of that song: ""He only out here for the dolla..."") And of the sound? It's a bit difficult to describe unless you are familiar with old-school, knee-slapping, granddaddy quarter-singing, pre-Kirk Franklin gospel. You really need to hear it in order to understand how he infuses the old-school sounds with jazzy gospel, R&B and a strong hip-hop beat. On some levels, you might say his music references the sound of Chance the Rapper and other newer school, non-trap artists from the Windy City.</p> <p>""I'm not doing the Gospel Fest in Chicago,"" says Sir. ""I'm not allowed to. My calling is sending me to Lollapalooza. There, I get to reach people that are just in the state of how I receive God. When I really received God myself I was smoking in a Honda. And suddenly I realized, 'you know what? I need to stop this. I need to focus.'""</p> <p>Sir is signed to Atlantic Records and touring the country with his own take on the gospel. He will play at Bonnaroo, the Afro-Punk Festival and Sasquatch, bringing his ""Chuchpeople"" choir with him at each stop. He squeezes in volunteer work between stops. That's his giveback given that some of his music might make traditionalists twitch.</p> <p>""You got lost into this monetization of spirituality,"" says Sir, in a criticism of the churches that cash in on the message of God. ""When the Pope came on a plane it wasn't eight people. He brought this whole country. Mission work ain't just about you and your pilot.... This album is almost like a sermon album for people to take with their life. There's songs about sex before marriage, making a woman your first lady and songs about being sick. There are songs about a little bit of everything. This first album? I really have to use it as a mission call.""</p>","No"

He dropped out on March 24, 2006, after about 14 months of campaigning, citing fundraising difficulties. Walker threw his support to fellow Republican Mark Andrew Green, who won the Republican primary unopposed, and Walker actively campaigned for him during the general election. Green lost the general election, in November 2006, to the incumbent Democrat, Jim Doyle.","Despite Green's loss, Walker's strong support for him helped increase Walker's favorability with the state GOP and positioned him as the frontrunner for the 2010 election.","<p>As he introduces himself to GOP primary voters nationwide, Scott Walker points to his long list of election wins in the swing state of Wisconsin -- 11, to be exact.</p> <p>Yet it's a single defeat, Republicans back home say, that reveals the most about his political character.</p> <p>He doesn't talk about the race on the campaign trail. But the hard-earned lessons from his failed, slapdash run for governor in 2006 have shaped Walker's career since, putting him on a trajectory that has led him to become one of the early front-runners for the 2016 GOP nomination.</p> <p>At the time, Walker was Milwaukee county executive, an elected position in the state's most populous county. He didn't last very long in the governor's race; trailing in the polls and short on cash, he dropped out six months before the Republican primary.</p> <p>He was the clear underdog from the outset. His opponent, Congressman Mark Green, had spent the previous four years laying the groundwork for a statewide campaign, building chits and securing support from donors and power brokers. By the time Walker launched his challenge in January 2005, Green had already locked down support from much of the Wisconsin Republican establishment.</p> <p>It's a standard template for a statewide run, but it's one that Walker overlooked in his impulsive bid. Green had assembled a well-oiled campaign apparatus led by Mark Graul, a Wisconsin strategist who oversaw George W. Bush's 2004 campaign in the state. Walker, by contrast, ran a shoestring operation. When he started his campaign, Walker wasn't just the candidate, he was also the main media contact -- and even put his cellphone number on news releases.</p> <p>""The lesson,"" said Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster who worked for Walker's 2006 rival and has closely followed Walker's career in the years since, ""was to go big or go home.""</p> <p>By the standards of today's hard-hitting Republican primaries, the Walker-Green contest was tame. Walker repeatedly stressed that his four years as county executive made him uniquely qualified to serve as governor -- an implicit knock on Green, a career legislator. Green's supporters, who were convinced that it was the congressman's turn to be the party's nominee, viewed Walker's challenge as an example of unchecked ambition.</p> <p>""He can't sit still in an office he holds,"" said Jim Klauser, a Republican power broker in the state who backed Green.</p> <p>Neither Walker nor Green, who now serves as president of the International Republican Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D. C., responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>By March 2006, trailing Green in polls and with only about $500,000 in his campaign account -- roughly a quarter of what his opponent had -- Walker decided to withdraw. The writing was on the wall: At a state Republican Party dinner that Green and Walker attended earlier in the month, Vice President Dick Cheney acknowledged Green from the podium but made no mention of Walker. The omission left some wondering if the Bush White House, eager to circumvent a primary, was trying to push him out of the race.</p> <p>The evening Walker made his announcement, he appeared side by side with his opponent at a political event in Waukesha, promising his ""full support and endorsement."" The two embraced.</p> <p>Many Walker allies look back on the day as a pivotal moment. Prior to the announcement, Walker and his advisers pondered launching a no-holds-barred offensive against Green. Instead, they settled on a different course, based on a cold-eyed assessment of the landscape.</p> <p>By wholeheartedly getting behind the front-runner and crisscrossing the state on his behalf, Walker could build party goodwill, not to mention preserve his viability as a future candidate. With 2006 shaping up to be a disastrous year for Republicans and Green likely to be the underdog in the general election, Walker's thinking went, he could endear himself to party activists and position himself for a 2010 campaign, when the political environment could be more favorable.</p> <p>""His departure from the 2006 race showed he's savvy enough to know how and when to pick his shots,"" said Brian Fraley, a public relations consultant in Wisconsin who served as a Walker spokesman in that effort. ""He bowed out because his only path to victory as an underfunded candidate was to run a scorched-earth campaign against his fellow Republican.""</p> <p>In the months leading up to the election, Walker became one of Green's most aggressive surrogates. He handed over his donor and volunteer lists. He hit the trail in the southeastern part of the state, his political base, urging residents to cast their ballot for his former rival. At the state party convention, Walker introduced the congressman.</p> <p>In November, Green suffered a resounding defeat. As Republicans looked toward the next gubernatorial campaign, they had a new front-runner waiting in the wings: Scott Walker.</p> <p>""In retrospect, the aborted 2006 race was a blessing,"" Fraley added. ""It was a terrible year for Republicans nationally. If he got the nomination then he likely would have lost the general election anyway. Instead, he was the fresh face for voters in 2010.""</p> <p>Darrin Schmitz, a prominent Republican strategist in the state who informally advised Green in the race, said he thinks 2006 was ""a turning point"" for Walker. ""He was playing the long game and it worked out for him.""</p> <p>As soon as Walker launched his 2010 bid, it was clear he wouldn't make the same mistakes as in his first statewide run. This time, he began with the basics -- lining up endorsements.</p> <p>Scott Klug, a former Republican congressman from the Madison area, remembers a Walker phone call just an hour after Rick Graber -- a former state party chairman and a Klug friend -- announced he wouldn't be running for governor. With Graber out, Walker wanted to know, could he have Klug's endorsement? The backing of party higher-ups, he explained, would be critical to his ability to secure the nomination.</p> <p>The answer was yes.</p> <p>""Mark came fast out of the gate and positioned himself with the Republican establishment,"" Klug said. ""He was dogged about endorsements.""</p> <p>Walker was also dogged about raising cash. Determined not to be underfunded again, he outraised his Democratic foe, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, nearly two to one. He did it by winning over the deep-pocketed donors who'd spurned him four years earlier -- including powerful attorney and former Republican National Committeeman Michael Grebe, a 2006 Green supporter who served as Walker's 2010 campaign chairman.</p> <p>Grebe is now playing a key role in guiding Walker's 2016 campaign.</p> <p>Walker replicated his prolific fundraising in a successful 2012 campaign to fend off a recall attempt and then again in his 2014 reelection campaign. In both contests, Walker clobbered his foes in the cash dash; he raked in nearly six times as much as Barrett in the recall and nearly twice as much as wealthy Democrat Mary Burke, the bicycle company scion who challenged him two years later.</p> <p>Walker applied the same disciplined approach in building his prospective presidential campaign. Klug, who's supporting Walker's candidacy, said the governor began raising money within a week of winning reelection in November 2014 as part of an effort designed to discourage other Midwestern GOP governors -- including Michigan's Rick Snyder, Ohio's John Kasich and Indiana's Mike Pence -- from jumping into the presidential fray.</p> <p>Walker also moved quickly to bring aboard several longtime allies for key roles, including Rick Wiley, the former Republican National Committee political director who is expected to be his campaign manager.</p> <p>""I think Gov.

Now they are throwing tens of millions of dollars into the presidential campaign, with the biggest checks going almost exclusively to Republicans and their ""super PACs."" The top donors include Trevor Rees-Jones, who left a law practice in Dallas and turned $4,000 in savings into an energy empire as the head of Chief Oil and Gas; Dan and Farris Wilks, abortion opponents whose trucking and equipment business struck gold in the fracking boom; and Karen Buchwald Wright, the head of Ariel Corporation, an Ohio manufacturer of gas compressors.</p> <p>Established Texas oil families are deeply involved in the campaign, too. Descendants of the late gambler and oil speculator H. L. Hunt - once thought to be the richest man in America - account for at least $2.3 million in donations in this presidential campaign. Mr. Hunt's fortune, feuds and multiple marriages are the stuff of legend: In the late 1970s, two of his sons reputedly tried to corner the silver market, and some say the Hunts inspired the classic television series ""Dallas."" At least three of his descendants have followed his path in Republican politics in the 2016 campaign. Among them is Ray Lee Hunt, the sole surviving Hunt heir with enough wealth to make the Forbes list of billionaires. (Mr. Hunt is No. 92 in the United States.) The family business, Hunt Oil, remains among the largest privately held oil companies in the country. Mr. Hunt and his wife have put more than $2 million behind Mr. Bush.</p> <p>They may disagree on politics, but they earned fortunes together. The hedge fund investor George Soros, who earned $1 billion in a bet against the British pound in 1992, is a prominent liberal donor and philanthropist who has given $1 million to a super PAC backing Hillary Rodham Clinton. His partner on that trade was Stanley F. Druckenmiller, who would become a prominent hedge fund manager in his own right, and is now close to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican. Mr. Druckenmiller is a strong advocate of reduced spending on entitlement programs, which he has called ""current seniors stealing from future seniors."" He has put a total of more than $300,000 behind Mr. Christie, Jeb Bush and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio.</p>","No"

She is a Wergaia woman from Horsham.","She released her debut album Friends With Feelings in 2018 and toured nationally with Emily Wurramara.","<p>Alice Skye and Emily Wurramara are in soft contrast to each other, and this soft contrast makes for the perfect joint tour. Emily is an island woman, hailing from Groote Eylandt, Alice a landlocked Wergaia and Wemba Wemba river woman. Alice, who opens their set, seemingly spends most of her time in her head, and her music forces you to get in yours. More than once, I catch her staring at her keyboard or at the ceiling, and wonder what she could be thinking about with a room full of people staring at her. I am not sentimental, but towards the end of Alice's performance in Brisbane, I found myself in tears. She was singing a song about a Gariwerd, a particular mountain range from my home. Her debut album,  Friends with Feelings, is melancholy and haunting, but doesn't leave you feeling depleted. It's hopeful, too. The same can be said for Emily's music: while I found myself crying to Alice's set, during Emily's I found myself dancing. Emily's album  Milyakburra isn't without pain or reflection, but it's upbeat. Songs like ""Yimenda-Papaguneray (Turtle Song)"" evoke joy and movement. Her set itself is a frenzy: there's constant dancing in the audience, and Emily swaps between acoustic and electric guitars.</p> <p>This duality between them both is, in some ways, revolutionary. Both musicians occupy joy and pain and refusing to choose between the two. Together they beckon the listener to hear and see them as humans capable of complexity. Alice herself acknowledges this in her song ""Poetry By Text"" when she says ""Let me tell you about science and art."" Mainstream audiences rarely see complex black women. Particularly in entertainment, black women are often positioned as palatable rather than political, which is why we see black artists like Jessica Mauboy singing the national anthem or performing in Eurovision. It's difficult to garner mainstream support and be explicitly, publicly pro-black at the same time.</p> <p>Nobody is immune to this: even Beyonce had to work over fifteen years in the industry before she could tell us to ""fuck a false arrest,"" and load her film clips with political imagery. Black women are rarely afforded complexity or encouraged to be complex. They are expected to perform a safe type of blackness and not make audiences feel uncomfortable. Neither Alice nor Emily are interested in this. Halfway through her set, Emily stops performing to speak to the audience. She calls for quiet, and starts talking about her home. She sings about Groote Eylandt's fight and victory against BP, and forces the predominantly white crowd to wrap their tongues around her language. Alice has almost lost her voice by the time she's performing, but still performs anyway. She still wanted to give back to the audience that had shown up for her. There are some notes she can't reach, her voice straining, but she seemingly isn't interested in being perfect: instead, she's striving for something authentic, to be seen just as she is. Despite their differences, there is much Emily and Alice have in common. Their voices, despite Alice losing hers, are both beautiful. I have not seen anyone force a room into stillness the way Alice does. I have not seen a room come together the way they do when Emily is singing.</p> <p>Both of these women are incredible performers, and these shows together are the first time they're touring as mothers. If they're nervous, you can't tell. These two women may be incredible black performers, and black women may seem themselves reflected deeply in their music, but Alice and Emily are for everybody. The two embody sisterhood, clearly quite affectionate in the way they join each other onstage and embrace during the show. This sort of love between black women is also revolutionary. Witnessing them perform together is like being around the table listening to your aunties tell their yarns. It's special: it feels warm in your heart, and when it's over you aren't quite ready to leave yet.</p> <p>Noisey: Thank you for last week. I found myself being really introspective and inside myself for your set Alice and then your set Em got me outside my head. Was that something you two thought about? The light and shade of your music together?</p> <p>Alice Skye: I hadn't really thought about it before but I love that.</p> <p>Emily Wurramara: Not at all! That's actually really interesting and beautiful you felt that way.</p> <p>Alice: A big thing about the tour was highlighting our similarities but also the differences between us. So I love that we offer different things when it comes to bein' live.</p> <p>How did you two meet?</p> <p>Emily: We met in Adelaide for a festival two years ago.</p> <p>Alice: It was cute. Em, I remember you messaging me on Insta.</p> <p>What did she say?</p> <p>Alice: [She said] ""Come to my hotel room I'm in number 315,"" so I go up and I'm knockin' on room 315 forever and no answer. Then [she] messaged me, ""Shit, sorry, room 513 lol.""</p> <p>Emily: Yes! Then I realised I gave her the wrong room number.</p> <p>Why did you message her Em?</p> <p>Emily: Well, I really was inspired by Alice and being at the same show I was like ""Omg we  have to hang out,"" I loved her presence, her vibes, and she just had such a welcoming personality. I really vibed with her at the show. And then when we hung out [and] it was just like kicking back with another sister.</p> <p>I guess in your industry it must be so hard to find other black woman on your same wavelength and when you find them you have to really latch on.</p> <p>Emily: Oh definitely! It's so hard to come across sisters in the industry who just ""get it"".</p> <p>Alice: Totally. I find the music industry so fucken scary, so having someone that gets what it's like to be young and be female and be black is life changing, honestly.</p> <p>I was talking to a tidda yesterday and she was talking about the pressure to feel perfect, and present as palatable.</p> <p>Alice: Yes! I was talking to another sister about how when you're young and perceived as kind of sweet and nice, as soon as you stand up for yourself people think you're being a ""bitch"" or being rude as but you're just trying to look out for yourself. I get that heaps cause I've always been a serial people-pleaser--but now I'm learning to say no and have boundaries for myself, and some people don't like it.</p> <p>Emily: It really feels like a sisterhood.</p> <p>Alice: Totally, I was so proud of you Em when you asked those people to just give you a minute on stage to talk. It was fucking deadly.</p> <p>Emily: You honestly feel that! You are constantly pleasing other people, and you constantly have to remind yourself that you're only human. You can only do so much. Seriously though, I can't stand when people [talk during performances], our music tells stories and if you're there, you're there to listen, to feel and to share.</p> <p>Alice: Yeah, I find it so emotionally taxing to perform. which sometimes makes me feel like ""Why am I choosing to do this?""</p> <p>Why do you do it? When does it feel worth it?</p> <p>Alice: Without music I wouldn't be able to process stuff. I'm not good at communicating my feelings with people, so I spend a lotta time in my own head and writing was just a way of getting that out. Being able to connect with people like Em has made it so worth it and just connect with people who find my music helpful for them.</p> <p>Emily: For me, music started when I went back home and saw there were no female singers or songwriters so I was like pretty much, ""Fuck it, I'm gonna do it.""</p> <p>How did you learn to play?</p> <p>Emily: I'm self taught in guitar, keyboard and ukulele, but I learnt saxophone, violin and flute. It's what I had to do to prove myself to my community and the men back home, I remember two years ago I went back and my uncle handed me an electric and was like ""If you play this like I do then you can jump on stage,"" so I did.</p> <p>That's so cool. What about you Alice?</p> <p>Alice: I started playing piano real young cause my big sister was learning and I just wanted to be like her.</p> <p>Are you excited for Sydney?</p> <p>Alice: I'm stressed as hell about it trying to organise everything. No one ever tells you how stressful being an artist is.</p> <p>Emily: It's so stressful, the things you have to organise! But I'm so excited for Sydney!</p> <p>Alice: Yeah I'm excited! I already miss ya Em so can't bloody wait.</p> <p>You must get so close touring, experiencing these wild and fun times together.</p> <p>Alice: I've never toured before so playing shows where people have come actually to see you and not by accident or to see someone you're supporting is really cool.</p> <p>Emily: It's great, Alice is literally like my long lost sis. We talk about everything, and to be able to share this tour with such an iconic artist and human being is my absolute honour. Australia needs to see this, we're two young Indigenous women doing what we love. And you're killing it sis!</p> <p>Is this your first tour as a mum, Em?</p> <p>Emily: It is sis, and it's so hard leaving bub at home but I'm not just doing it for me and her. I feel I have a responsibility to be a role model for all the young women around the world especially in my community, it's heavy but shit needs to be done.</p> <p>You make it look easy but I'm sure it's fucken tough. Not to mention all the other things that come with being a black mother.</p> <p>Emily: It's so tough! The amount of stereotypes and things people say so easily, it can hurt but you've just got to deal with it.</p> <p>Alice: Well since we're on the note of Em and how much of a rockstar mum she is, [she's] the highlight of the tour for me.</p> <p>Alice: I was just lying in bed with Em and little K'iigari and watching Em sing to her and just laid there and cried. It was so beautiful. I'm not good at shoutouts but I love my mum and my sisters and women are amazing.</p> <p>Emily: Aw, I can't wait to see you! Shoutout to all the young sisters out there, your ancestors got your back.</p>","Yes"

He models his albums after his live show and is building his career through the performance aspect. His first studio album, Friday Nights & Sunday Mornings, was released on April 22, 2010. This 13-track album includes the first song he ever wrote/recorded, “Larger Than Life”, which is about the passing of his father. In March 2011, he released Country as Me, a 6-track EP featuring his single ""Buzz Back"". He has received air play as a ""Highway Find"" on satellite radio channel The Highway (Sirius XM).","In April 2012, his Dirt Road Communion debuted as #48 on the Billboard Country Albums chart and was the #6 download on iTunes for the week.","<p>Spend any amount of time with country newcomer Chase Rice, and you will no doubt be inspired by his infectious drive and confidence. And, he's got a lot of reasons to feel that way. The singer is opening for some heavy hitters this spring, including Jake Owen and Joe Nichols (this weekend), and his latest album, ""Dirt Road Communion,"" is doing well. In April, it debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Country Albums chart and No. 15 on Heatseekers.</p> <p>""It was awesome,"" the North Carolina native said about receiving the news concerning the first-week sales tally, which also included a No. 6 on iTunes. ""'Knowing all the success it had, I was ecstatic. I worked on it for about a year. I produced it, wrote the songs, and sang it. So, I put my entire life into it. To know that the fans responded like they did was an amazing feeling.""</p> <p>Rice, who you may recognize from his runner-up finish on ""Survivor: Nicaragua"" a couple years ago, told Billboard that he tried to pattern his album around his live show. ""That's what I base my whole career on, getting out there and doing live shows. I'm just trying to put out music they can relate to, and that's awesome to see that happen.""</p> <p>He looks at his career on stage the same way he did playing on the football field at North Carolina under legendary coach Butch Davis. ""When I was in college football, if I didn't get in there and study film on my own time, I wouldn't be very good. At the same time, if I don't get in the studio, or writing sessions, it's not going to happen.""</p> <p>Rice says that he is trying to build his career slowly but surely, concentrating on the performance aspect, in a similar way to what Brantley Gilbert or Corey Smith have done. He's very excited to be opening for Joe Nichols this weekend in Sanford, NC. ""Joe is this weekend, and that's cool. It's been neat to have a lot of these shows. I love being out on the road -- I would love to be out there even more. The Joe Nichols show kind of fell in my lap, since we have such a big following in North Carolina. My biggest thing with a live show is that I hope people will have an awesome time and say 'He just gets better and better with time.' That's my goal.""</p> <p>The singer is also excited about the progress he has made as a tunesmith. ""I moved to town and started writing,"" he said, allowing that it has been very therapeutic. ""I wrote every song on the album besides one. I started writing while in college right after my dad passed away. It was my way of dealing with it, I guess. I don't open up to many people about things, but 'Jack Daniels and Jesus' was probably one of the most personal songs. It says a lot of things that some people are scared to say. But, for some reason, I couldn't say it in conversation, but in a song, I can pour it out. It's my way of getting who I am out to everyone.""</p> <p>In the future, Rice wants to continue to develop his live show, and expand his audience. ""I'd like to take it on the road. I'll sing to anybody. I'll take any venue, wherever. I am nowhere close to arenas and stadiums yet. I just want to get out to the fans. I promise the ones that do come are going to say 'That's one of the best times I've ever had.""</p>","Yes"

When his father Patrick was stationed away from home, he would put himself on video reading books to Christopher and his sisters and their mother would send recordings of her children to her husband. Sean explained that he was always very comfortable in front of the camera and those experiences inspired him to get into acting. Growing up, Sean had a big poster of Bruce Lee on his wall and admits there weren't many people for him to relate to in the entertainment industry.","Sean speaks Japanese, which he picked up from his parents when his father was assigned to the USS Tripoli.","<p>Days of our Lives' Christopher Sean (Paul Narita) is all the buzz in every sense of the word. Not only does it seem like nobody can stop talking about his character and the havoc his presence has wreaked on the relationship between Sonny (Freddie Smith) and Will (Guy Wilson), but he was also the main subject of a recent Buzzfeed article that praised his performances during Paul's emotional coming out scenes. The noise surrounding Sean has certainly been big, but he seemed calm at the center of the storm during Soap Central's chat with the actor.</p> <p>As exciting as the past several months have been for Sean, he's been able to keep his feet planted firmly on the ground -- partially due to the way he was raised, and partially due to the fact that landing the role almost seems kismet. ""It's pretty crazy the way it worked out,"" he explains of the fact that before he was hired, DAYS didn't really know what they wanted from the character. ""It was a really big casting call. They didn't know what they wanted, and after speaking with the casting director, Marnie Saitta, she said it came down to a group of Asian boys, a group of black boys, a group of white boys, and there was a large amount of all of them,"" he reveals. ""And it dwindled down to three races: it was myself, a black gentleman, and a white gentleman. So just the three of us, and they still didn't know what they wanted. We were doing a network test, and Freddie Smith had to actually kiss all three of us.""</p> <p>At this point, the powers that be still didn't seem to know what they wanted from Paul, but a phone conversation Sean had with Saitta sealed the deal. ""I went home and got a call from Marnie, who said, 'Hey, do you speak Japanese?' And I said, 'Yeah, I do,'"" he recalls. ""So I sent in a video of me speaking Japanese, and then they were like, 'Okay, I think we have our decision.' Then I got a call from my agent saying that yes, I got the role. But in essence, they didn't know what they wanted, and luckily, I was chosen. And I thank God every day that I get to be a part of this spectacular show, especially it being the 50th anniversary.""</p> <p>Admittedly, Sean was a bit hesitant to sign on with the soap, not because of the role, but because of his lack of knowledge on all things daytime. ""On my second callback, they said to me, 'Hey, are you comfortable playing a gay role?' And I said, 'Yeah, that's fine,' but I went home, and I called my manager, and I said, 'Hey, man, do you think this is going to be a wise choice?'"" he recalls. ""And my manager... just broke it down to me how many people started on soap operas. So I was just kind of questioning, because I didn't know, but it got to a point where I said to myself, 'I'm bartending. I want to be an actor,' and to play a role like this, that has so much meaning to it, I thought, you know, 'This is bigger than me. If they actually do choose me, I'd be honored.' So I was very happy to jump on board.""</p> <p>READ MORE: Guy Wilson weighs in on the WilSon drama</p> <p>However, being the son of a Japanese mother and a dad who worked in the Navy, Sean was a bit hesitant to break the news to his parents. In fact, he likens it to the somewhat similar stress real-life homosexuals might feel when they tell their parents they're gay. ""Culturally, it is taboo to have dishonor in any way in the Japanese heritage, and I grew up in the military, with my father being in the Navy, and even there, [the subject is] very taboo,"" he explains. ""So it was nerve-racking for me... I almost had my own little coming out where I said, 'Guys, I'm going to be playing a homosexual on television. What are your thoughts?'""</p> <p>Fortunately, their reaction mirrored Paul's family's reaction. ""Both of them reacted so positively, and they supported me so much,"" he says. ""It was one of those things where I was like, 'Whoa, I can't believe I was stupid enough to even be worried.'""</p> <p>Once he broke the news to his parents, however, he then had to face the possible wrath of DAYS fans. Being that WilSon is the first male/male married couple in daytime, the pairing is quite beloved and special -- which Sean knew right away. ""I remember saying to Freddie and Guy, 'I'm sorry!'"" he says with a laugh. ""But as I tell everyone, every good show needs conflict. Without conflict, there's no storyline. So I was like, 'Look, I'm only giving you guys more work, and we're going to have a lot of fun doing it.' And they were like, 'Heck yeah! High-five.'""</p> <p>Though WilSon won the hearts of many DAYS fans, Paul's presence on the canvas has created some conflict. ""The writers and the directors of the show have done a really good job of keeping us in the world, kind of like a Twilight battle, where you have team Edward and team Jacob, but instead, it's team PaulSon and team WilSon,"" he points out. ""So they are really puppeteering such a great storyline.""</p> <p>As it stands now, it looks as if Will and Sonny's marriage is crumbling. Sonny knows that Will slept with Paul, which was devastating news for the club owner. And unfortunately for Paul, Sonny's anger isn't only directed toward his husband. Paul was left having to explain that he had no idea that Will was Sonny's husband, and he also was left begging Sonny to understand that his fling with Will didn't mean anything.</p> <p>""Paul has an admiration and a respect for Will for helping him come out. They did have sex, and they did share that romance... but it's one of those things, as an adult, you experience somebody, and you know whether or not it works,"" Sean explains of Paul's feelings toward Will. ""With Sonny's character, Paul has true love for him, and it's one of those [loves] where he's got the white wedding planned in his mind, and 'Everything can be perfect, all I need is him.' So in Paul's mind, Sonny is his other half.""</p> <p>As for whether or not Paul will feel guilty for hurting Sonny, even though he truly had no idea that Will was his husband, the actor says the audience will have to wait and see. ""But what I can say,"" he previews, ""is that it's going to be a rough-and-tumble ride for the three of them [because the writers] are genius with what they're doing. They know what they're going to do, and they've been doing it for 50 years strong, and so I'm just one of the crowd and excited to see what they come up with.""</p> <p>Though fans are eager to find out what will happen between Paul, Sonny, and Will, they're just as curious about where Paul comes from. In fact, rumors are swirling that he'll be revealed as the son of a major character on the canvas -- with many fingers pointing to Stefano. So what does Sean think of the possibility of his alter ego being a DiMera? ""We film six months ahead, and I know a lot more, so to even give an opinion would sway people, and I try to stay away from swaying people in any direction,"" he says with careful consideration. ""But I can, however, say legitimately that the actors that have been on the this show for so long [are incredible], and to be able to play their son would be an honor.""</p> <p>As for whether or not he's noticed any Stefano or Chad-like qualities in Paul, the actor remains just as cryptic. ""I'm very tunnel vision when it comes to the show, because I'm trying to focus on what Paul knows only. I actually don't even read other people's storylines, because I want to be just as surprised as Paul is in the moment, so I stay away from that entirely,"" he explains. ""But I love Billy Flynn [Chad]. He is such a great actor, and he has captivating eyes. Great guy. This is just a personal opinion, but I love him.""</p> <p>No matter how it turns out, Sean is thankful for the chance to portray such a layered and unique character. ""Paul is a groundbreaking character and [written] true, so to be able to play this character, it just makes my heart fill with joy,"" he says of being one of only three prominent gay Asian characters on broadcast television (the other two being Conrad Ricamora's Oliver Hampton on How to Get Away With Murder and Parry Shen's Brad Cooper on General Hospital, both of whom are on recurring status rather than contract like Sean).</p> <p>In fact, the actor's original goal was to find a career in which he could help people, with acting being at the top of the list. He explains that his father was in the Navy, and his way of communicating with the family while he was away at sea is what originally inspired Sean to start acting. ""At the time, he would record himself reading us books, and he would send the tape to our mom, and she would play that tape for us, and we would sit in front of the TV watching our dad [perform the words in the books],"" he shares. ""As he was reading, he'd say, 'Christopher, sit down!' And I was like, 'What?! How did he know I was standing?!' And then my mom would get the camcorder, and she'd record us, and I remember as a kid, the stick figure of a man that I was, I would say, 'Yeah, I'm getting big and strong. I'm going to catch up to you, dad!' So I was always comfortable in front of the camera, and I always wanted to be on TV. And I've always wanted to help, in some way, everyone. So knowing that, I thought, 'How do you help a broad amount of people? Well, acting or politics,' and I thought, 'Well, I want to be an actor, because then at least I can do action films and then I can use that platform and help change lives with non-profits,' so I was like, 'Well, that's what I'm doing. I'm going to change lives.'""</p> <p>Days of our Lives may not be an action film, but the show handed him the perfect character to change lives, and Sean has already impacted many viewers who struggle with the truth about themselves or a loved one. ""I've gotten messages from people saying, 'I wish I had the bravery that you have,' and I never say, 'Just do it!'"" he shares of his responses. ""I say, 'You know, when your time comes, you're going to live however you want to live, whether you're honest with yourself or if you're not. It's your life. You're going to live it happily or hidden, it's your choice.' I always tell people, though, the bottom line is the more honest you are with yourself, and the more honest you are with other people, the more people will respect that. Whether they love you or not, they'll respect that.""</p> <p>And as for the important scenes in which Paul came out to his mother and grandfather, the actor says he tried not to be nervous when it came time to film. ""I just thought about being as honest to the material as possible,"" he says. ""I studied and studied and studied, I kid you not. I mean, probably just that night, I studied for like six or seven hours, just going over the same material over and over and over to make sure I was there, mentally. And I was still there mentally [the next day]. I got to set, and they were like, 'Chris, are you okay?' I was already where I needed to go in the scenes. But, yeah, I wasn't nervous at all, because I'd put so much work into it, and I was prepared to be as honest to the material as possible.""</p> <p>In the end, he's proud of the work he did that day but credits the crew for the impact they delivered. ""I saw them, and I thought, 'Wow,'"" he enthuses. ""I mean, the way they shot it, the way they edited it, the music behind it, the portrayal of Paul, I mean, the show did such a great job with this storyline, and like I said, I'm enamored by the writing and with the team.""</p> <p>Who do you hope ultimately takes Sonny's heart: Will or Paul?

Please upgrade your browser.</p> <p>PARIS -- President Barack Obama remains by far the most popular world leader among people in major Western nations and is the one political figure on whom people consistently pin their hopes in the economic crisis, according to new polls conducted for the International Herald Tribune. About 80 percent of people in France, Germany, Italy and Spain have a positive view of Mr. Obama, a ratio that declines only slightly, to about 70 percent, in the other two countries surveyed, Britain and the United States. The only politician who comes close is Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who gets a positive rating from two-thirds of those in Continental Europe but from only one-third of Britons and Americans.The new survey, conducted by Harris International for the I.H.T. and the cable news channel France 24, reinforces the results of one conducted a month earlier showing that about half of those surveyed expressed the most confidence in Mr. Obama's ability to solve the economic crisis, with Mrs. Merkel coming in second, at 22 percent.The surveys found that a solid majority of people in the major Western democracies expect a rise in political extremism in their countries as a result of the economic crisis. Even in the United States and Italy, the two countries whose citizens are least likely to hold that view, fully 53 percent of those surveyed say more extremism is ""certain to happen"" or ""probable"" in the next three years.</p> <p>""I believe there will be a rise in political extremism in the United States, particularly from the right, between now and the next presidential election,""  said Robert J. Kepka of Addison, Illinois, one of the people surveyed who agreed to a follow-up interview by e-mail. He said he expected such a result, however, ""not as a result of the current economic crisis, but rather the perceived erosion of conservative Christian values.""

However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in Shan and Kachin states, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and by 2017 the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated to the point that it is not uncommonly called a genocide.","Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing.","<p>It was never meant to be this way.</p> <p>The script called for the lead actor, a Nobel prize winner, to seize control of a country, bring peace where there was conflict and prosperity where there was poverty. A nation emerging from years of military dictatorship was to become a beacon of hope not only for its cowed population but also for much of a fractured and turbulent south-east Asia.</p> <p>But like many political dramas - especially over the past 12 months - the script has not been followed by Myanmar and its de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.</p> <p>Now, a year since one of the world's most famous prisoners of conscience came to power in the specially created position of state counsellor, the talk is not of progress.</p> <p>Instead, it is of drastically escalating ethnic conflicts that have simmered and sporadically exploded for decades; a new Rohingya Muslim insurgency that has prompted an army crackdown some say may amount to crimes against humanity; a rash of online defamation cases that have fostered a panic over freedom of speech; and a repressive legal framework that allowed the generals to jail so many still being in place. And all the while, Aung San Suu Kyi is accused of remaining mostly silent, doggedly avoiding the media.</p> <p>Interviews by the Guardian with more than a dozen diplomats, analysts and current and former advisers reveal frustrations with a top-down government struggling to cope with immense challenges. Aung San Suu Kyi's questionable leadership style, her inability or unwillingness to communicate a vision, and her reluctance to speak out against the persecution of minorities have raised the question of whether the popular narrative is misplaced.</p> <p>And although some defend her, saying it takes time to right the wrongs of decades, others see a fundamental misunderstanding of the woman herself.</p> <p>""Many of the people who led the campaign [to free Aung San Suu Kyi] ... were more on the liberal side of the spectrum,"" one diplomat put it. ""I think she's closer to a Margaret Thatcher.""</p> <p>It's a stark contrast to the Aung San Suu Kyi who, during 15 years of house arrest at her lakeside villa on University Avenue in Yangon, stood on rickety tables and delivered speeches about human rights over the gate.</p> <p>""And she was electric,"" said David Mathieson, a longtime Myanmar researcher for Human Rights Watch who is now an independent consultant. ""She was funny. She was informative. She was principled ... And I think it's lamentable that she's not doing the equivalent of that now.""</p> <p>Five hours north by car from Yangon, Myanmar's dystopian capital Naypyidaw stands surrounded by densely forested mountains.</p> <p>It is here, in the so-called Abode of Kings supposedly built to insulate Myanmar's generals from attack, amid a landscape of deserted 20-lane highways and grandiose hotels, that Aung Sun Suu Kyi lives her life in power.</p> <p>The 71-year-old is a disciplined ruler. Her habit, established during imprisonment, is to wake before dawn and meditate in the house she shares with her pet dog and a small retinue of maids.</p> <p>She has breakfast with an adviser, often Kyaw Tint Swe, a former ambassador who spent decades defending the junta's actions.</p> <p>An aide, Win Htein, says Aung San Suu Kyi eats very little. ""The amount of food she is taking is like a kitten,"" he said. ""She doesn't eat carbohydrates. Fruit and vegetables. No pork, or mutton, or beef. Only fish.""</p> <p>Her few indulgences include a vast wardrobe of luxurious silk longyis and evening film viewings, musicals being her favourite. Win Htein recently gave her a copy of La La Land.</p> <p>But mostly she works. And there is a lot of work.</p> <p>As well as state counsellor - a position created to get around the military-drafted constitution that bars her from the presidency - she is foreign minister, minister of the president's office and chair of numerous committees. Widely described as a micromanager, she pores over documents after hours. A source close to the attorney general's office says she asks to see a copy of every draft bill before it is submitted to parliament. Ministers routinely pass decisions upwards.</p> <p>""The problem is there are no policymakers in her cabinet,"" said Burmese political analyst Myat Ko.</p> <p>People who know her say Aung San Suu Kyi inspires both devotion and fear. She is variously described as charming and charismatic, and sharp and authoritarian. ""She feels like a real leader,"" one diplomat said. ""Intelligent, quick-witted, quite funny."" At the same time, he added: ""I would say that she has appeared to be very keen to be the sole decision-maker to have no chance of establishing rival power centres.""</p> <p>Echelons above her subordinates in stature, the state counsellor is often depicted as living in a bubble, surrounded by a cabal of advisers who are too nervous to convey hard truths. A Yangon-based analyst working on the peace process said bad news often does not reach her.</p> <p>""In meetings, she is dismissive, dictatorial - in some cases, belittling,"" said a senior aid worker who, like many others interviewed for this story, insisted on anonymity because he works with the administration. The government, he said, has become ""so centralised, there is complete fear of her"".</p> <p>This is not the administration many hoped for when the National League for Democracy (NLD) took over the government last year following victory in the 2015 election. The circumstances of this seismic shift in Myanmar has admittedly been far from ideal for cohesive, effective government. The army has retained control over key ministries as well as the security forces. But the election and transfer of power from the previous military-backed government were smooth.</p> <p>""Most transitions end badly: the Arab spring and many other examples,"" said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based political analyst. ""At the same time, transitions are always bumpy and I think Myanmar is going through a particularly bumpy moment in its transition.""</p> <p>Before those bumps, the first few months brought good news for the new administration. Aung San Suu Kyi released scores of political prisoners. She announced the creation of a Kofi Annan-led advisory commission on Rakhine state, where the minority Rohingya Muslim community has been persecuted for decades. Major peace talks were held in August with armed groups. By mid-September, the US pledged to lift all sanctions.</p> <p>But cracks were there from the start. The announcement of her cabinet was met with ridicule when it emerged several of her new ministers had phoney degrees.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi did not have much choice. The only people with experience in government were from the previous regime. But she is said to have a small network and is slow to trust people, a legacy of her house arrest and persecution.</p> <p>Obsession with party loyalty soon became a theme. NLD legislators were told not to speak to the media in the run-up to the election and then were ordered not to raise tough questions in parliament.</p> <p>The silence held through October, as a fresh crisis unfolded in Rakhine state, and November, when four ethnic armed groups formed a new alliance in the north.</p> <p>Peace was Aung San Suu Kyi's priority, she said before taking office. But conflict has escalated to unprecedented levels in Shan and Kachin states, with tens of thousands of refugees driven over the border into China.</p> <p>As a Bamar Buddhist, Aung San Suu Kyi hails from the dominant ethnic group. ""The Lady"", as she is lovingly referred to across the country, built a following across Myanmar's fractured ethnicities by taking trips to the border regions since 1989, often wearing local dress.</p> <p>But ethnic leaders have recently questioned the extent of her sympathies with minorities. Her government has put out statements condemning abuses by ethnic armed groups, ignoring aggressions from the military. In one case it labelled a major ethnic organisation a terrorist outfit. The peace process analyst said she has one strategy: ""to have good relationships with the Tatmadaw [army]"".</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi's squeaky-clean image had already begun to blur in 2012, when she did not speak out after a surge in sectarian violence that led to the deaths of hundreds of people, mostly Rohingya Muslims, in Rakhine state. In an apparent concession to domestic racist factions, her party blocked Muslims from running for parliament in 2015.</p> <p>Many people put her ruthlessness down to political expedience and fear of an unpredictable military. Win Htein, her adviser, cited something she told him in 1988: ""She told me, since she decided to get involved with politics, she would change everything. Any criticism directed towards her, she wouldn't care.""</p> <p>The biggest moral challenge of her leadership is posed by Rakhine state, a tinderbox of tension between minority Rohingya Muslims and majority Buddhists.</p> <p>The northern part of the region exploded into violence on 9 October after nine police officers were killed on the western border with Bangladesh by Rohingya armed with swords and makeshift rifles.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi got the news in the middle of the night. The morning after, she convened a sombre meeting with government and police officials. ""She was not worried, [but] she was not calm. She was upset,"" Win Htein recalled.</p> <p>Soldiers sealed off the remote corner of the country, barring media and aid access. Tens of thousands of Rohingya, whom many in Myanmar regard as illegal ""Bengali"" immigrants from Bangladesh, fled across the border to refugee camps. They have recounted mass killings and rape, accusations which the military denies. One woman who spoke to the Guardian said troops raped her, killed her husband and seven of her children. One child survived, she said.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi's government has angrily dismissed many of the claims as ""fabrications"". The words ""fake rape"" were plastered over her official Facebook page. A report by a government-appointed committee cited the presence of mosques and ""Bengalis"" to dismiss the accusations. It was a clumsy response. ""We have had conversations about messaging,"" said one diplomat.</p> <p>Yet the foreign ministry last week said a UN resolution to send an independent international fact-finding mission to Myanmar ""would do more to inflame, rather than resolve, the issues at this time"".</p> <p>A south Asian envoy said three months passed before Aung San Suu Kyi's deputy at the foreign ministry visited the Bangladesh embassy. According to the diplomat, they offered to repatriate some Rohingya but made no reference to hundreds of thousands of others living in Bangladeshi camps since fleeing previous waves of violence.</p> <p>""I can say that the government is only round about a year old but we haven't seen a concrete indication towards really addressing the situation as far as Rakhine state is concerned,"" the diplomat said. The Myanmar foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>And then a personal blow. In December, more than a dozen fellow Nobel laureates wrote an open letter to the UN security council warning of a tragedy ""amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity"". It cited the ""potential for genocide"".</p> <p>Few people who know her believe Aung San Suu Kyi is prejudiced, though they do say she is afraid of being painted as cosy with Muslims by powerful, radical Buddhist influencers.</p> <p>""I think she sees it sort of like older white guys in America: they're not racists but they don't prioritise [race],"" said one diplomat.</p> <p>But when, 10 months into her rule, one of her advisers, a prominent Muslim lawyer, was assassinated, her silence left many dumbfounded.</p> <p>Ko Ni, a constitutional lawyer who helped create the state counsellor position, was shot dead on 29 January as he stood outside Yangon international airport, holding his grandson in his arms. For a month, Aung San Suu Kyi made no public comment. She did not even call the family.</p> <p>It was only after she attended his memorial service at the end of February that she made her first public statement on the matter.</p> <p>The immense authority retained by the military means the state counsellor has limited power over what happens in conflict areas. But even in sectors well within its purview, the government is seen to be falling short.</p> <p>Foreign investment is set to plunge 30% for the year ending 31 March, according to a report in the regional business publication the Nikkei Asian Review. The downturn is attributed in part to a vague economic vision.</p> <p>The NLD's parliamentary majority gives it the ability to amend and remove oppressive laws, including the notorious 66D clause in the telecommunications law that has been used to jail scores of people for Facebook posts critical of the government and army. But, instead, senior NLD officials began using it with an order to pursue some of the cases against critics coming from the highest levels of government.</p> <p>By the start of 2017, at least 38 people had been charged with online defamation, some unrelated to the NLD, including two men who allegedly went on a drunken rant about Aung San Suu Kyi and one who called her puppet president, Htin Kyaw, an ""idiot"".</p> <p>Champa Patel, Amnesty International's regional director for south-east Asia and the Pacific, said: ""This is not the change the NLD promised to deliver during last year's elections.""</p> <p>Meanwhile, western diplomats continue to give Aung San Suu Kyi the benefit of the doubt. Few supported the establishment of a UN-backed commission of inquiry - the highest level of probe - on the Rohingya crisis.</p> <p>""There's a belief by some important actors that we just need to support her to steer the country,"" said the analyst who works on the peace process. ""That's not been successful.""</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi's aides turned down requests for an interview. Win Htein, who also works as the NLD spokesperson, praised her silence as politically astute and said media interviews were too ""time-consuming"".</p> <p>Win Htein - a man in his mid-70s who sleeps with an oxygen tank - has a reputation as the party disciplinarian.</p> <p>Speaking at his home, a military-style dormitory for MPs in Naypyidaw, he added: ""Please tell those who are disappointed in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi or in us just [to] look at the history ... More than 27 years we have struggled. Through real hardship. So this point is too early. They have too high expectations.""</p> <p>So far, the government has successfully clamped down on corruption and fostered a climate of free speech, he said, adding that ""there is an argument for both sides"" for the 66D clause. He said claims that Aung San Suu Kyi was the sole decision-maker in her cabinet were ""rubbish"".</p> <p>Governance, he said, has meant constant negotiation with the army. Members of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development party have told him they plan to challenge Aung San Suu Kyi's state counsellorship as unconstitutional.</p> <p>Win Htein's views on the Rohingya reflect common prejudices in Myanmar. He said the ""Muslim lobby"" exaggerates the plight of the group, even though 120,000 have been confined to camps in Rakhine state since 2012. He said the ""illegal immigrants are flowing into our country like a stream since many decades ago"" and that Islamic practices are incompatible with Buddhist beliefs.</p> <p>Win Htein cannot speak for Aung San Suu Kyi. But it seemed pertinent to ask if he thought she might have private sympathy for the Rohingya.</p> <p>He paused and then said: ""No.""</p>","Yes"

Often these cliched images also dominate the imagination of artists from abroad. But four American artists - Carrie Fonder, Lily Stockman, Rebecca Layton and Jenny Mullins - have tried to break free.</p> <p>In an exhibition titled Super/Power, their visual narratives are filled with a different set of images: autorickshaws, godowns, mobile phone towers and electrical transformers. The art works attempt to foster a dialogue between the mythologies of the old and vibrant India with New India. Curator Georgina Maddox says ""each artist has employed multiple mediums to engage with the subject of India."" Through paintings, sculptures, drawings and installations - they express themselves in an exhibition on view from April 1-16 at Threshold Art Gallery.</p> <p>Detroit-based Fonder's sculptures deal with issues of gender and the way culture influences gender identity. Her work uses the ubiquitous autorickshaw that she purchased in October 2010 to illustrate her responses to the hijra (eunuch) community in India. ""I was inspired by the beauty and boldness of the hijras that I encountered in my daily life in Mumbai as well as the rickshaws. Hijras got me thinking about the hardships they face not only as hijras but also as women,"" says Fonder.</p> <p>Her creation titled Trans-co takes a multi-cultural look at gender while paying homage to hijras and autorickshaws. ""It's a play on American car culture; at the same time it nods reverentially to the world of amazing rickshaw customisations visible throughout India,"" says Fonder who's fascinated by the dualities of India. Despite stereotypical and historical trappings, India is also contemporary and unique, she says.</p> <p>LA based Stockman, who grew up on a farm in central New Jersey, was always attracted to the collision of the natural and built environment: how man shapes his surroundings. Last year she moved to India and was fascinated to see the same thing happening here.</p> <p>Her works titled Full Humidity and Pink Mughal are contrastingly minimal as they play out areas of suburban India that sit between the rural and urban. ""For centuries Western artists have come to India to capture masterpieces of Indian architecture like the Taj or the Humayun's Tomb. But I'm interested in the uncelebrated, the unglamourous and the banal monuments of contemporary India. Using grain elevators, silos, plinths and godowns as my unlikely subjects, I've depicted these structures as mechanisms for the measurement of production and consumption"" says Stockman who researched newspapers, visited state-run ration godowns and new hydraulic-powered grain silos in Punjab for her project.</p> <p>Layton came to India to study block printing and miniature painting in Jaipur. She uses contemporary images of new India such as mobile phone towers and concrete buildings as source material for her work.</p> <p>""The project involved designing my own patterns, translating them into wooden block carving, then having those printed on fabric,"" she says.</p> <p>meenakshi.sinha@timesgroup.com</p> <p>Download The Times of India News App for Latest City News.</p> <p>more from times of india Scuffle breaks out at Patiala House Court during 1984 riots case hearing01:12Bhubaneswar: Fans resort to vandalism after failing to get tickets for Men's Hockey World Cup01:39On cam: Passengers save man from coming under moving train in Mumbai00:47Caught on Camera: Youth rides on the rim of the bus in Chennai01:30Medchal bike rally: Ch Malla Reddy, supporters refuse to give way to ambulance01:05Arms supplier who sold weapons to Maoists nabbed by Delhi Police01:35</p>","Yes"

""I was waiting for it.""</p> <p>* Teammates go wild after Martinez's first homer</p> <p>The same could be said about this version of Martinez on the mound, though to a smaller degree. All spring, Cardinals officials hoped the influence of new pitching coach Mike Maddux would help elevate Martinez from his status as the club's top pitcher and into the conversation of the game's top pitchers, period.</p> <p>More than a month into the season, he's been just that, the owner now of a 1.40 ERA across seven starts. Wednesday, he plucked predominantly from his bucket of different fastballs to hold Chicago to one run in 7 1/3 innings, scattering five hits and striking out five against two walks.</p> <p>""We've seen seven starts at that next tier,"" Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. ""That's consistently the type of stuff and execution that puts you on a different level, and he's been there. I looked up at the scoreboard and saw something about his April numbers being as good as anybody ever in this uniform. That says a lot about the start that he's had.""</p> <p>Martinez allowed two runs across 33 1/3 innings in April, giving him the lowest first-month ERA by a Cardinals starter since at least 1913. Throw out an ugly Opening Day start in March, and Martinez was a strong candidate for National League Pitcher of the Month, which Max Scherzer won Wednesday. Scherzer pitched under Maddux with the Nationals, giving the Cardinals an elite pitcher for Martinez to look to as a template.</p> <p>Video: CWS@STL: Carpenter charges ball, gets out at first</p> <p>""They pushed me, always telling me to focus and never lose it,"" Martinez said. ""This is my opportunity right now.""</p> <p>And still, it was his bat that stole the show Wednesday.</p> <p>""I was trying to help myself,"" Martinez said.</p> <p>He did by ambushing a first-pitch fastball from losing pitcher Lucas Giolito in the sixth, breaking a scoreless tie with a 407-foot shot that landed in the left-field bleachers. Always a relatively strong contact hitter, Martinez had previously managed just six extra-base hits (all doubles) across 227 career plate appearances. He celebrated by taking a 27.9-second trot around the bases that teammates compared to Yoenis Cespedes, the Mets slugger known for not exactly hurrying after he leaves the yard. Martinez then earned a water splash from Dexter Fowler, and among other celebratory antics typical of the Cardinals dugout.</p> <p>""He's the guy who a lot of time is leading a lot of the stuff that happens after our home runs, so I'm sure they were ready to reciprocate,"" Matheny said. ""He wanted to relish it, make it last. It didn't bother me.""</p> <p>Groggy for much of the afternoon, the Cardinals offense awoke from there. Fowler added a two-run homer off Giolito, before the White Sox inched closer against Dominic Leone in the eighth. Bud Norris earned his sixth save, and second of more than three outs, to preserve Martinez's stellar day on both sides of the ball.</p> <p>MOMENTS THAT MATTERED</p> <p>Fowler takes flight: Fowler's two-run homer in the seventh gave the Cardinals a three-run lead, and marked the 100th long ball of his career. It also came with the right fielder mired in a 2-for-21 funk, his batting average resting at .161 before the at-bat.</p> <p>""My confidence is always been there,"" Fowler said. ""But anytime you get hits, you're happy.""</p> <p>Fowler has been hitting down in the order for much of the last week, after his second straight slow start.</p> <p>""Dex felt good about his swing today,"" Matheny said. ""You can talk about it all you want, but once they feel it, it's not going to translate. Good things happen when Dex finds the barrel.""</p> <p>Another save for Norris: Yo-yoed back and forth from the closer's role in response to Greg Holland's rough start, Norris again proved dependable at the back end. He stranded the tying run at first in the eighth after the White Sox crawled back with two in the frame, then pitched a 1-2-3 ninth. Norris is perfect in six save chances, and sports a 1.72 ERA across 15 appearances overall.</p> <p>""It's amazing how Bud has come through in big situations,"" Matheny said. ""He's one of those guys that's pretty rare right now, who you can go to for four or five outs, and he figures out a way to get it done. What an addition to our club he's been."" More ></p> <p>Video: CWS@STL: Norris gets grounder to complete the save</p> <p>SOUND SMART</p> <p>* Martinez did not hit a batter for the first time this season, and for the first time in eight starts dating back to last year. The seven-game streak with at least one hit batsman was tied for the third longest in baseball history.</p> <p>* Yadier Molina went 2-for-3 with a run scored in his 1,743 career game caught. He passed Johnny Bench for sole possession of 16th place on the all-time list.</p> <p>YOU GOTTA SEE THIS</p> <p>It was first baseman Jose Martinez who compared Carlos Martinez's slow trot around the bases to Cespedes, a comparison that's strikingly accurate. According to Statcast(tm), it takes Cespedes 27.44 seconds, on average, to circle the bases after a homer. That's only a half-second slower than Martinez took.</p> <p>Video: CWS@STL: C. Martinez smacks his first career home run</p> <p>HE SAID IT</p> <p>""He loses his bat, his bat hits the batting cage. Watching him take BP is always funny. He takes a thousand swings with everything he has."" -- Jose Martinez, talking about Carlos Martinez.</p> <p>UP NEXT</p> <p>Busch Stadium figures to be packed when the Cubs come to town Friday at 7:15 p.m. CT, for the first of a three-game set.

His personality varies depending on his alignment as a hero or villain. As a hero, Angle usually performs as a role model, but as a villain, arrogantly uses his achievements to insult other people. He mixes aspects from his amateur wrestling background into his in-ring work, performing various suplexes, including the belly-to-back, German or Overhead belly-to-belly, as well as submissions, such as the Rear naked choke or the Triangle choke.","He primarily performs two finishing maneuvers to end his matches: an Olympic slam, dubbed ""Angle Slam"" and an ankle lock, sometimes dubbed ""Angle Lock"".","<p>Kurt Angle's intensity is unmatched, and his technical wrestling skills are unparalleled. Possessing an unprecedented competitive streak that fueled him to become a 1996 Olympic Gold Medalist, Angle dominated the amateur ranks before emerging as one of the most successful WWE Superstars of all time.</p> <p>Starting his athletic career as a football and wrestling star in his hometown of Pittsburgh, he soon became one of the top amateur wrestlers in the U. S., winning a pair of NCAA titles at Clarion University. But Angle truly captured national attention in 1996 when he won the 220-pound freestyle wrestling competition at the Olympic Games in Atlanta with a broken neck.</p> <p>Four years after earning Olympic gold, Angle entered WWE and immediately became one of the most competitive individuals to set foot in the squared circle. Just weeks after his debut, Angle, who preached the virtues of his three I's (Intensity, Integrity and Intelligence), won the European Championship.</p> <p>Shortly thereafter, he captured the Intercontinental Championship and was crowned King of the Ring in 2000. With momentum propelling the red, white and blue-clad grappler to new heights, he defeated The Rock at No Mercy to win his first of four WWE Championships.</p> <p>During his tenure in WWE, The Wrestling Machine tussled with the greatest Superstars of The Attitude Era, including ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, The Rock, The Undertaker, Triple H, Big Show and even John Cena in The Cenation Leader's debut.</p> <p>Angle departed WWE in 2006, but his seven years as a Superstar raised the level of competitiveness for the entire roster and gave the WWE Universe some of the greatest bouts of all time. His three I's made him an easy selection for the WWE Hall of Fame's Class of 2017 and a full-time role in WWE as Raw General Manager.</p> <p>But even as a GM, Angle isn't averse to getting into the ring as a competitor, and The Olympic Hero made his triumphant return to action at WWE TLC to take Roman Reigns' place alongside Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins in an epic 5-on-3 Handicap Match, captained Team Raw to victory in the Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match at Survivor Series 2017 and teamed with Ronda Rousey at WrestleMania 34 to take down Triple H and Stephanie McMahon.</p> <p>Simply put, in-ring dominance is in Angle's blood, and that signature tenacity is a trait regularly demonstrated by his son, Jason Jordan.

Focused primarily on New York City feeder communities, this tool, he named ZenoRadio, recruited its first users who were new residents hailing from San Jose de las Matas, Dominican Republic; San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago; and Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Herzfeld set up alternative voice over IP routes in these immigrant hometowns to keep families affordably linked between their old and new lives.","Today these connections extend to more than 25 countries, from China, Cambodia, Nigeria, and Congo, to Nicaragua, Haiti, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic.","<p>Cellphones As Radios: Immigrants Dial In To Native Stations : All Tech Considered   ZenoRadio hooks up more than 1 million listeners to radio stations around the world by making a call to a U. S. phone number. The company founder came up with the idea when he realized that most U.S. cellphone plans have unlimited calling, and many immigrants have cellphones but no on-the-job Internet connection.</p> <p>Cellphones As Radios: Immigrants Dial In To Native Stations</p> <p>Cellphones As Radios: Immigrants Dial In To Native Stations</p> <p>Cellphones As Radios: Immigrants Dial In To Native Stations</p> <p>Boubacar Sanogo from Mali drives a cab in New York City and listens to ZenoRadio on his smartphone -- though it can also be accessed using a more basic model.</p> <p>A year and half ago, Baruch Herzfeld, an entrepreneur in New York City, had a novel idea: connect immigrants in the U. S. with radio stations in their home country using nothing more than a cheap cellphone. ZenoRadio employee Atif Enin, who's from Egypt, points to a list of countries, each with a U.S. phone number. ""This is for a local Egyptian station; this is for Lebanese, Moroccan, then Syrian, Yemeni, Algerian, Iraqi and Somali,"" Enin says. Ahmad Mohammed has been listening to ZenoRadio for about a month. ""When I listen to the Egyptian music every day,"" he says, ""I feel as if I'm living home, I'm back home."" Zeno assigns a U.S. phone number to a radio station's Internet stream. ""If you press extension 1 [it's] one radio station, 2 is another one, 3 is another one, 4 is another one. If you press star, you can change it,"" says Herzfeld, the company founder. And the system works because most people with cellphones have combined data and calling packages, many with unlimited minutes for phone use. ""But they figure, who is going to be on the phone? It turns out my guys will be on the phone for 12 hours a day,"" Herzfeld says. Herzfeld says he can ask a taxi driver who is running for New York City mayor, and the driver will have no idea, but if he asks, who is running for president of your country? ""They will know the 10 or 11 guys,"" he says. Herzfeld revels in the many languages, tribal dialects and cultures of the 2,000 or so stations on ZenoRadio. The company won't share its financials, but it earns money from advertising and from investors. And it gets a couple of cents per call from telephone routing companies that have space and want more business. Boubacar Ba from Mali is in charge of all the French-speaking radio stations on ZenoRadio -- about 100, many from West Africa. He can monitor how many people are listening to any of those stations at any time. ""I see Radio Nostalgie from Guinea is my No. 1 station,"" Ba says. ""Right now in the New York area, they have 29 people, 31 now. It is constantly updating. No. 2 is Zik FM from Senegal."" Boubacar Sanogo, also from Mali, drives a Yellow Cab 10 to 12 hours a day. He's been in America 13 years, has a family and a college degree. He listens to ZenoRadio maybe five hours a day. He says he listens to news from his country, and he also listens to French news. He says it's changed the shape of his day. ""Driving the cab for 12 hours is really boring, so with this radio I can see the time flying,"" Sanogo says. Herzfeld says that many listeners are in solitary jobs. ""They feel culturally isolated. So it may not even be the most exciting content in the world, but it provides him solace as he spends his day."" And given how many people have cheap cellphones compared with computers, Herzfeld says the possibilities for the global expansion of ZenoRadio are endless.</p>","No"

On February 17, 2017, Tiberi told the Ripon Society that his plan to change the ACA was more complex than a single piece of legislation. It involved relying on the regulatory power of Tom Price as HHS Secretary, the budget reconciliation process, and bipartisan legislation. His comments also suggested that he no longer thought a full repeal of the ACA was necessary. He said ""it's not just about repealing.","Maybe it's about modifying some provisions of the Affordable Care Act.""","<p>WASHINGTON, DC - U. S. Rep. Pat Tiberi (OH-12) appeared before a breakfast meeting of The Ripon Society yesterday morning to discuss the effort underway on Capitol Hill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>Tiberi serves as Chairman of the Ways & Means Subcommittee on Health. As such, he will be one of the key architects of any reform plan that is approved. In his remarks, he made clear that replacing the problem-plagued health care law will not be accomplished in one fell swoop. Rather, it will be a multi-step process that will require White House leadership and Democrat support.</p> <p>""We're not going to do it in one bill,"" Tiberi stated. ""When the Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, it wasn't in one bill. It wasn't just reconciliation. And it wasn't just passing a law. Kathleen Sebelius was given incredible authority at HHS to implement the Affordable Care Act. And quite frankly, they were continuing to do that last year under the new administrator designee, Andy Slavitt, and the new HHS Secretary.</p> <p>""And so we know -- and Tom Price, the new Secretary, knows -- that much can be done to unwind it and replace it at HHS. We're not sure exactly what, but he's in that process right now. That will actually help us a ton to allow us to know what we actually have to do through reconciliation. We're still trying to figure out what we can do through reconciliation because of the Byrd Rule in the Senate, and where votes might be in the Senate. And that process continues to take a little bit of time.""</p> <p>As the Chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, Tiberi has led the charge on solutions to increase choices, reduce costs and put patients at the center of our health care system. He has also established a reputation as someone who is willing to work across the aisle to get things done.</p> <p>""I told this to Sandy Levin yesterday,"" he said, recalling the conversation he had with the Health Subcommittee's Ranking Member about the possibility that some reforms could be considered through a series of smaller bills. ""We'd like to get Democrat support. It's not just about repealing. Maybe it's about modifying some provisions of the Affordable Care Act that we can get some Democrats to agree to in the House. Because we're going to need Democrats in the Senate to agree to them. And obviously right now the environment's really toxic -- really, really toxic.""</p> <p>Despite these and other challenges, Tiberi said that both Congress and the President remain committed to moving ahead with reform and solving the many health care problems that people face.</p> <p>""Premiums have skyrocketed over 100 percent,"" the veteran lawmaker said. ""We had another health insurance company announce just yesterday that they were pulling out of the exchange. We've known now for a long time that this is unsustainable. I would argue that it was designed to be unsustainable. So we're continuing to try to have that discussion. But we are committed to do this. We have to do this. Failure is not an option.""</p> <p>The Ripon Society is a public policy organization that was founded in 1962 and takes its name from the town where the Republican Party was born in 1854 - Ripon, Wisconsin. One of the main goals of The Ripon Society is to promote the ideas and principles that have made America great and contributed to the GOP's success. These ideas include keeping our nation secure, keeping taxes low and having a federal government that is smaller, smarter and more accountable to the people.</p>","Yes"

OF COACHING about executive coach Marshall Goldsmith, 53... Goldsmith trains executives to behave decently in the office, by subjecting them to a brutal regimen. First, he solicits ""360o feedback""-he asks their colleagues and sometimes their families, too, for comprehensive assessments of their strengths and defects-and he confronts them with what everybody really thinks. Then he makes them apologize and ask for help in getting better. It's a simple method-""I don't think anybody's going to say I'm guilty of excessive subtlety,"" he says-but it works... Goldsmith is so extraordinarily buoyant and extroverted that he seems to enter a room in a tinkle of magic dust... His head is round and pink and bald, his eyes are blue, and his chin juts out and upward to meet his nose, like the chin of a wooden puppet. He skips more than walks, and when he is in a bouncy mood (which he usually is) he dances along with his arms straight out and swinging... When Goldsmith started executive coaching, in the early eighties, he was a pioneer. Coaching really came into its own as an industry about five or six years ago, when employee retention became a serious problem... . Moreover, a bad attitude on the part of senior management was held to be detrimental not only to retaining employees but also to the formation of strategy. Some executives remain suspicious of coaching, thinking of it as a reproach or as enforced psychotherapy, but more often these days the offer of a coach is taken as a compliment-a sign, since the service is expensive, that a person is being groomed for significant promotion. Coaching, he had recently realized, was not, ultimately, about changing his client's behavior so much as changing perceptions of the client's behavior. If you ask Goldsmith to describe the principles of his happiness, he will say that they are best summed up by Buddhism. Goldsmith has been a Buddhist since his mid-twenties, and now he likes to think of himself as a kind of Buddhist monk, spreading the good news. Buddhism is also the underpinning for Goldsmith's third-favorite saying, after ""Life is good"" and ""Be happy now"": ""Let it go."" ""Most Western religions glorify guilt,"" he says. Goldsmith's Buddhism meshes perfectly with his behaviorist-style coaching. He always tells his clients that he doesn't care about their past, doesn't care how they feel, doesn't care about their inner psyche-all he cares about is their future behavior. Even if he didn't believe it was unproductive, Goldsmith would reject the psychotherapeutic approach on the ground that it just takes too long. One of Goldsmith's favorite facts about himself is that he has more than seven million frequent-flier miles on American Airlines alone. It is impossible, he tells people, unless you have at least a million or two miles yourself, to comprehend what that means. Once, when he was at the symphony with his wife, Lyda, she noticed him digging into the side of his chair and asked what he was doing; he realized that he was looking for a seat belt... . He lives in a gated community near San Diego named Fairbanks Ranch, because years ago the land was owned by Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Mary Pickford. His house is an unpretentious two-story Tudor... It is very peaceful in Fairbanks Ranch. Even during the day, there is almost no traffic, and at night little brown rabbits leap over the lawns. The weather is perfect. Bill Gates and the Sultan of Brunei are said to own homes in the neighborhood. One reason Fairbanks Ranch seems like Heaven to Goldsmith is that he grew up in a bad neighborhood-the rough part of Valley Station, Kentucky, just outside Fort Knox. His father owned a gas station, and the family lived between the gas station and a bar. There were a lot of other bars and strip joints nearby, and soldiers were always driving into town and getting drunk and getting into car wrecks or bar fights. The street in front of his house was nicknamed the Dixie Dieway... Mentions his daughter, Kelly, who is famous for her own appearance on the television show, ""Survivor""... Tells about his rebellious youth and his participation in encounter groups in Los Angeles... Writer describes a final session with a C. F.O. client...</p>","No"

Since 2005, he has produced 13 films, including the ""Transformer"" movies, ""Salt"" and ""G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" With ""Red"" poised for release this week, his films have already grossed nearly $2.6 billion worldwide.</p> <p>""Lorenzo is sort of a rare mix of being entrepreneurial, tenacious and creative, which is the perfect storm for a producer,"" Paramount Film Group prexy Adam Goodman says. ""A lot of people are big talkers  --  he's a doer.</p> <p>""Everything you hope a producer can be, he's got those skills, and he's just got a great eye for material to boot, so we couldn't be happier to have him here at Paramount.""</p> <p>Di Bonaventura, a symphony conductor's son who grew up in the college town of Hanover, N. H., ""thinks in a very big-picture way, and that comes from his studio background,"" says the Weinstein Co.'s Bob Weinstein, who worked with di Bonaventura on the 2007 horror film ""1408.""</p> <p>""It's a genre film, but it grossed more than $70 million,"" Weinstein says. ""He taught me that an audience can be broadened out.""</p> <p>Generally, though, di Bonaventura is drawn to broader-appeal pics.</p> <p>""As an executive, I've been largely in charge of big movies,"" he says. ""I gravitate toward my taste.""</p> <p>And his taste is action  --  in film and in life.</p> <p>After Harvard, di Bonaventura owned a whitewater rafting company, taking clients on New England rivers including Maine's Kennebec and Penobscot. Even now, he tries to raft twice a year and hit the Grand Canyon annually.</p> <p>""It's 24 people out in the middle of nowhere,"" he says, ""with one thought on their mind: How do we maximize the amount of fun that we have?""</p> <p>And he says his experiences guiding people down rapids on an adventure have come in handy in making movies.</p> <p>""You learn how egos operate under extreme pressure,"" he says. ""We have a lot of that here. Extreme pressure, I mean.""</p> <p>His long-standing friend, the producer and Academy Award-winning writer Akiva Goldsman, says di Bonaventura's love of rafting is an example of his courage.</p> <p>""He will grit his teeth, start shouting tyrannically like the captain of some long-lost naval vessel and lead you over the most daunting rapids you can imagine,"" Goldsman says. And Goldsman, who produced ""Constantine"" with di Bonaventura, says his friend's courage extends to business.</p> <p>He remembers being new in Hollywood and getting a call from di Bonaventura, who was a creative exec at Warner Bros. ""I sat down with him, and he took out a pile of scripts, about four of them ... and he said, 'I have no power here, so none of these scripts are meaningful to anybody. But I'd hire you for scale to rewrite any one of them.' It was my first job.""</p> <p>Goldsman says that di Bonaventura's willingness to take a risk extends to his filmmaking  --  and makes him a great producer.</p> <p>""Lorenzo has a huge heart, and he also has really big opinions, but he's also able to listen, and that combination is elusive,"" Goldsman adds.</p> <p>Di Bonaventura likes to listen, likes to analyze, likes to read, likes to think.

""You have to entertain your audience,"" he says.</p> <p>Di Bonaventura attributes his success  --  part of it, at least  --  to  three things he learned from Bob Daly and Terry Semel, his former bosses at Warner Bros.: how to be a strong advocate, how to see the many different elements of putting a picture together and how to make a decision.</p> <p>""I'm a little bit of a grinder,"" di Bonaventura says. ""I like working hard, and I sort of feel like you can make up for talent by grinding.""</p> <p>He says that the Warner Bros. culture taught people how to make decisions, and that when he works with people who have worked there, he knows they'll make decisions, too.</p> <p>""I recognize that in some fellow alums, like Rob Friedman,"" he says.</p> <p>Friedman, the co-chairman and CEO of Summit Entertainment, which is distributing ""Red,"" praises his former Warner Bros. colleague.</p> <p>""He's a very, very logical thinker, he's very detail-oriented (and) he cares about your money like it's his money,"" Friedman says.

T.,"" I called my best friend in college. I. T. and I had quite a reputation for activism, having (among other projects) saved the JTS library after it suffered a devastating fire in 1966. But that's a story for another time.</p> <p>The Six Day War broke out June 5, 1967. Throughout May, roughly a month before the war, everyone knew the war was coming. UN Secretary General U Thant pulled the UN troops out of the Sinai Peninsula, leaving Israel exposed; Nasser bragged about driving the Jews into the Mediterranean Sea; the tension was so thick it could be cut with a knife.</p> <p>I was a junior at Yeshiva College in Manhattan; I. T., a sophomore. The word was out that when the war came, Israel's farmer soldiers would leave their farms and the crops would rot for lack of manpower. The Arabs could kill the Israeli economy if they tied up Israel in a war, even if the Arabs ultimately lost.</p> <p>So went the scenario. It was extremely plausible. No one -- not a single eminence in Israel's military or political echelon -- predicted a six-day victory, let alone a victory at all.</p> <p>And so, I. T. and I had the idea of sending volunteers to Israel's kibbutzim. Don't ask me how we passed our courses that semester, for this is what we did:</p> <p>First, we convinced the phone company (without permission from the university) to wire our dorm rooms with multiple lines. Then we went to work. This was the agenda:</p> <p>To convince as many students as possible to volunteer for the summer on Israeli kibbutzim. The heavy cloud of impending war meant that we had to convince not only the students, but often their parents and the Israeli authorities. We also had to put in place a system for a quick acquisition of passports.</p> <p>And quick reservations on the increasingly rare seats open on the few planes still flying into Israel.</p> <p>Not to mention, money to pay for it all.</p> <p>We asked no permission from the Jewish Agency, which, officially, was responsible for sending volunteers to Israel. We just acted.</p> <p>As word got out, money started pouring in. Rabbis raised money in their synagogues; people came in off the street; students pulled from their pockets or parents. People would literally hand us envelopes of cash, at first once or twice a day, then many times daily. We had credibility, for we actually succeeded in getting students to Israel. First a few, then a trickle, and finally a flood.</p> <p>The lines for passports were long. We did not accept that. Upon pressing the American authorities, we discovered that, by law, a citizen has a right to a passport within 24 hours (at least that was the law then). We pressed our rights to the fullest.</p> <p>At first, ""we"" was I. T. and I. Quickly, the cadre of activists grew. By the time June 4 rolled around, we had several groups of student activists: experts in passport procedures; lobbyists at the Jewish Agency, who needed to approve the volunteer applications; and lobbyists at the airlines, who were very choosy to whom they issued seats.</p> <p>Our money spoke. For every student who was willing to volunteer, we had the money for the airline ticket and the passport.</p> <p>At a certain point, the Jewish Agency turned over the keys to its offices. We now had as much space as we wanted to do our work, but the hub remained at our college dorm rooms. Morning, noon and night, they were abuzz with activity.</p> <p>Each potential volunteer was a challenge. This one wanted to go, but his parents didn't agree; this one's parents agreed, but there was no current, valid passport; this one didn't want to miss classes, and needed to be convinced that saving Israel was more important than grades for one term.</p> <p>I don't remember how many tens of thousands of dollars went through our hands; I don't remember how many Yeshiva students actually volunteered. I do remember that we had several students on the last flight out of New York before the war.</p> <p>In some ways, it was a typical '60s effort: Think for the moment; everything for the cause; nothing for daily responsibilities -- and give the authorities fits (the authorities at YU, the Jewish Agency, the State Dept.). In other ways it was not typical: no drugs or promiscuity, just an idealistic, positive effort. Rather than rail against the establishment, we bent it to our will. The bottom line was that Israel trumped all.</p> <p>In a moment, we were shut down.</p> <p>The Yeshiva shuls filled with students and with rabbis saying Psalms, as fervently as I've ever heard.</p> <p>There was a news blackout for the first day or two of the war.</p> <p>Israel had won -- and won in a lightning flash.</p> <p>There were no farmer-soldiers pulled from the kibbutzim for an extended time.</p> <p>All the student volunteers we sent would now have a memorable experience, basking in the afterglow of the miraculous Israeli victory. They would not be slaving away on the kibbutzim.</p> <p>Whatever the level of Israel-consciousness at Yeshiva before the war -- and obviously, it must have been high; otherwise all those students would not have volunteered -- it was ten times higher when all the volunteers came back to Yeshiva the next fall. Israel was on everyone's mind; everyone wanted to go there.</p> <p>Not to study -- there were no Israel study programs then. But they sprouted fast. At first, the only place to go was The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Then the yeshiva programs started.</p> <p>For a few frantic weeks in 1967, I. T. and I rode the wave for all it was worth.</p> <p>This is reprinted from the IJN, May 13, 2005.</p>","No"

As of 2008, he had written or co-written more than a dozen articles about prisons, as well as a book (""Punishment and Inequality in America"") on the same topic. In ""Punishment and Inequality in America"", originally published in 2006, he concludes that ""mass imprisonment has erased many of the ""gains to African American citizenship hard won by the civil rights movement."""" In a 2010 study, Western and fellow sociologist Becky Pettit outlined the way in which, according to them, poverty increases prison populations and these populations in turn increase poverty. Other studies co-authored by Pettit and Western have found that on average, incarceration reduces annual salaries by about 40% for the average male former prisoner, and reduces hourly wages by,on average, 11% and annual employment by nine weeks.","As of 2013, Western was also studying what happens to prisoners after they are released, and has interviewed the subjects of the study in person, which has, according to Elizabeth Gudrais, ""put a human face on the statistics and dashed preconceived notions in the process.""","<p>When Jerry enters the pizza place next to Boston's Government Center, he shakes Bruce Western's hand heartily. Jerry, who has served 25 years for armed robbery and aggravated rape, was released two months ago. Western is studying what happens to prisoners after their release and has come to interview Jerry about his experience.</p> <p>After ordering them coffees, Western, a sociology professor and faculty chair of the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management, turns on his tape recorder. ""Today is the sixth of November,"" he says, setting the recorder down on the table. ""My ex-wife's birthday,"" Jerry (not his real name) notes wryly. Western reads out the four-digit number that identifies Jerry for the purposes of the study. ""I should play that number in the lottery tonight,"" Jerry says.</p> <p>Jerry is quick with a joke, charismatic and likable--not what comes to mind when one hears ""convicted rapist."" For Western, this has been one of the study's chief lessons. Although he is one of the foremost experts on incarceration in America, in the past he primarily studied prisoners through datasets and equations. Meeting his subjects in person put a human face on the statistics and dashed preconceived notions in the process.</p> <p>Western has come to believe that just as offenders' crimes carry a cost to society, so too does the shortage of social supports and rehabilitative services for offenders. A crime-control strategy of locking up more people, and keeping them locked up longer, isn't working, he says. He is determined to help the American public understand how crime is shaped by poverty, addiction, and histories of family violence, in an effort to promote a more humane--and more effective--prison policy.</p> <p>More than 2.2 million Americans are incarcerated. This population is dynamic: hundreds of thousands of people (mostly men) are released from U. S. prisons each year to try to make a go of it in a world where they have failed before--with the added disadvantage of a prison record. More than two-thirds will be rearrested within three years; half will go back in prison.</p> <p>Those released from prison are, as a group, little studied, partly because maintaining contact with them is so difficult. The men tend to be ""very loosely attached to families and jobs,"" Western explains. Prison time strains relationships with partners and children, and the men often live separately after their release. They may move frequently, sleeping on the couches of friends and relatives or even becoming homeless as difficulty in finding employment begets financial trouble.</p> <p>Tracking this group, though complicated, is essential to Western's goal of understanding what challenges prisoners encounter in reintegrating into communities. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, he is tracking a sample of inmates released from the Massachusetts prison system who return to Boston-area addresses during the course of a year. The researchers collect friends' and relatives' information (to maintain contact when, for example, a subject's phone is disconnected for nonpayment) and work with community street-workers and the Boston police, who may have information on the former prisoners' whereabouts. Ultimately, Western hopes to learn what services might most effectively help the formerly incarcerated lead productive lives and what alternatives to prison might better improve public safety.</p> <p>The challenges are great. The difference between the prison environment and the outside world can be jarring in the extreme. Jerry confides during his interview that he's had trouble sleeping at the shelter for homeless veterans where he lives: he isn't used to other people in his sleeping space. Inside the medium-security prison, inmates fought all day long, he says, but ""when the cell door would click closed at night, that was the only time you were safe. No matter what beef anyone had with you, it had to wait until morning."" At the shelter's dorm-style room full of bunk beds, with people moving around all night, Jerry is constantly on edge: ""It's like my body left the prison, but my mind is still in there.""</p> <p>The outside world brings an onslaught of stimulation, the sudden need to make dozens of small decisions each day, when before, the prisoners were expected to do as they were told. ""Adaptive behavior in prison is maladaptive behavior outside,"" explains Marieke Liem, a postdoctoral fellow at Western's HKS program. She is investigating the effects of long-term incarceration and prisoners' reentry using data from the United States and her native Netherlands. In both her study and Western's, subjects have said they simply can't cope on the outside--that going back to prison seems comforting and familiar.</p> <p>The psychological challenge of reintegrating is often layered on top of other adversity--for example, childhood trauma. Jerry was five when his father went to prison for three years for shooting Jerry's mother in the head during a drunken fight. (Luckily, the bullet went through her ear and her jaw, not her brain; deafness in one ear was the only lasting effect.) After his father's return, Jerry recalls, ""I would stay awake at night listening to them fight, wondering what he was going to do to her."" In many cases, says Western, ""the violence people bring into the world has its roots in violence they witnessed, or which was done to them, at very young ages."" With stories like Jerry's, he notes, ""the line between victim and offender is very fuzzy indeed.""</p> <p>Jerry started drinking when he was nine and left school after the ninth grade. This history of alcohol abuse is also typical among current and former inmates: at least two-thirds are thought to have substance-abuse problems--no surprise, given that people steal to get money for drugs, or commit other crimes due to impaired judgment while under the influence. In effect, American prisons are used as surrogate mental-health and substance-abuse facilities. The nonprofit Human Rights Watch found that 56 percent of U. S. inmates are mentally ill.</p> <p>Jessica Simes, a doctoral student who is a research assistant in Western's study, tells of one subject, mentally ill and addicted to drugs, who failed a drug test that was a condition of her parole and was sent back to prison for the remaining 15 months of her sentence. She had received prescription anti-anxiety medication while in prison, but bureaucratic delays held up a new prescription once she got out. Besieged by anxiety and desperate to feel calm, she used heroin. ""The medical community has determined that addiction is a disease,"" says Simes, ""but the criminal-justice community considers it a crime.""</p> <p>In cases like these, the reasons people landed in prison in the first place make them more likely to end up there again. This is why Western favors more robust support for prisoners who are released. ""In most cases,"" he says, ""these are poor people with few social supports, real behavioral problems, or tragic family histories.""</p> <p>Although Western's team is still conducting interviews, the researchers have already identified some factors that seem to aid prisoners in reintegrating. As it happens, Jerry exited prison with several advantages. First, he is 51. Older offenders are less likely to commit new crimes and end up back in prison, perhaps because youthful tempers fade, or because maturity brings an awareness of what one has missed.</p> <p>Moreover, Jerry has housing--he can stay in the shelter for the first year. He had $5,800 in the bank at the time of his release, saved from his work-release job. And his sister lets him come over and search job postings on her computer in exchange for doing her dishes.</p> <p>Jerry also has good relationships with his sons, ages 28 and 29, even though he's been absent for most of their lives. He speaks with each of them daily. When he thinks about his sons, Jerry feels motivated to find a job. He wants to get his own apartment so he can offer them a place to stay, save up a bit of money to loan to them if they need it. ""I want to be their shelter in the storm,"" he says. ""Be there for them because all those years I couldn't.""</p> <p>Still, finding work might prove difficult. Jerry makes an excellent first impression--neatly groomed, intelligent, self-aware--but he struggles with emotional control. When a nurse declined his request for anti-anxiety medication at a recent appointment, he told her, ""When you see me on the six o'clock news, you'll know you made the wrong decision."" The nurse called security and Jerry was detained for 45 minutes, frisked, asked to remove his shoes and belt. ""It was embarrassing,"" he says. ""Very embarrassing."" Many, perhaps most, former prisoners have trouble handling difficult emotions and keeping their cool during disagreements--crucial skills for workplace success.</p> <p>""So many pieces have to come together"" to set newly released prisoners on the path to a productive, stable life, says Caroline Burke '13, a social studies concentrator who is one of Western's research assistants. ""If someone isn't on the right track after the first few weeks, there's a snowball effect.""</p> <p>The few inmates who do reintegrate without much difficulty, who are best positioned to deal with the psychological effects of the transition, have the ""big three"" in place: they have a job lined up or find one quickly (e.g., through a trade union they previously worked with); they have housing (often with a relative or through a social-service program); and they have access to healthcare and treatment for substance-abuse and mental-health issues as necessary. The most effective reentry programs address these factors, and Western recommends directing more resources their way.</p> <p>One more factor that can tip the odds is a mentor. Anthony Braga, M. P.A. '02, a senior research fellow in the HKS program and chief policy adviser to Boston's police commissioner, found that this was the key feature of the successful Boston Reentry Initiative. A joint project of local, state, and federal government, it matches each inmate being released with a mentor from a community organization. Braga, a longtime lecturer at Harvard who is now a professor at Rutgers, found that high-risk offenders who participated in the program and received mentoring took 30 percent longer to end up back in prison, and their offenses were far less likely to be violent crimes when they were rearrested. He says these results ""show that you can make inroads and start getting them away from the pressures that lead them to falling back into their old ways."" (But Western notes that keeping expectations modest is important: ""Some of the most successful reentry programs,"" he says, ""only reduce recidivism by 10 percent."")</p> <p>Jerry does have a mentor, his case worker at the shelter, a woman he calls ""an angel."" Most recently, when his state-paid health insurance was canceled in error, she helped him get it reinstated. Not all former prisoners have advocates like this, notes Catherine Sirois '10, the project manager for Western's study; most are released into a piecemeal system where the assistance they receive relies on ""luck, not a plan.""</p> <p>The United States has the dubious distinction of having the world's highest incarceration rate: more than seven-tenths of 1 percent of the population (about 1 in 100 adults) are in prison. Only eight countries have rates above one-half of 1 percent. The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, has nearly one-quarter of its prisoners.</p> <p>Stricter treatment of drug offenses, and longer sentences for violent and repeat offenders, underlie this high rate. The United States currently has 41,000 inmates serving life sentences without parole, according to a recent report; England has just 41. Yet as recently as the 1970s, the U. S. incarceration rate was one-fifth its current level. Then tough-on-crime laws passed at the state and federal levels with bipartisan support.</p> <p>Now, the United States has reached ""mass incarceration""--""a level of imprisonment so vast that it forges the collective experience of an entire social group,"" Western writes. He has found that 60 percent of black male high-school dropouts in the United States will go to prison before age 35. The deterrent effect of incarceration is lessened if it becomes so common that it no longer carries any stigma. ""The American prison boom is as much a story about race and class,"" he writes, ""as it is about crime control."" Reentry services for released prisoners go only so far; making a real dent in the size of the prison population will require intervening in a cycle that begins long before any crime is committed.</p> <p>But making that dent requires an honest look at hard-to-face truths. Two factors greatly increase the odds of going to prison sometime during one's life: being black or Hispanic, and being poor. Poor minorities do commit more crimes, but that only explains part of the disparity. ""Small race and class differences in offending are amplified at each stage of criminal processing, from arrest through conviction and sentencing,"" Western writes. A criminal history accumulates that reflects not just criminal conduct, but the influence of race and poverty, and this in turn shapes later decisions about sentencing and parole release. Western and many fellow prison-policy scholars have observed that American criminal-justice policy is built on the rhetoric of personal responsibility--paying for one's bad decision--to the exclusion of asking why minority and low-income groups are so much more likely to make bad decisions, or how society fails them.</p> <p>Two other factors that greatly increase one's odds of going to prison--low educational attainment and a lack of employment opportunities--are closely linked, and are connected to one decision: to drop out of school. That decision is often made by teenagers leaving public-school systems ill-equipped in any case to prepare them well for the modern work force. The dimensions of this multifaceted disadvantage may be even more closely linked than is immediately obvious. As one example, Patrick Sharkey, Ph. D. '07, a sociologist at New York University, found that children's scores on vocabulary and reading tests fell in the days after a homicide in their neighborhood, presumably due to emotions such as fear and anxiety. In a neighborhood violent enough to affect long-term school performance, even education is not an easy ticket out of poverty.</p> <p>One of Western's students has found that the disparities begin even earlier. For her thesis in sociology and African-American studies, Tiana Williams '12 drew connections between race-based disparities in discipline in K-12 education, and race-based disparities in incarceration. Analyzing data from a large national survey, she found that African-American students were significantly more likely than white students to be suspended from school, even though they did not misbehave any more frequently. She also showed that students who were suspended were more likely to be arrested subsequently than students who were never suspended--indicating that the way children are treated in school helps set them on a path for later life.</p> <p>Unless underlying social problems are addressed, says Catherine Sirois, nothing will change: ""Our priority should be, how do we keep children from growing up in communities where selling drugs is their best career option?""</p> <p>As prison populations and expenditures ballooned, states began to realize their policies were unsustainable. Yet, even as politicians and the media focused in on prison reform, actual change came slowly.</p> <p>Take the case of California, which made headlines last year when the amount budgeted for corrections surpassed that earmarked for higher education. (Incarcerating one person for a year costs tens of thousands of dollars, and in some places rivals the price of tuition at an elite university.) In the wake of a Supreme Court order to ease prison overcrowding by releasing more than 30,000 inmates, California voters in November scaled back their ""three strikes"" law, so the mandatory 25-years-to-life sentence for a third offense is restricted to serious or violent crimes.</p> <p>This was not the first time California voters had considered such a change. Western believes the United States has finally reached ""a reform moment"" for prison policy. As voters chafe at swollen prison budgets and the costs of social disruption--an estimated two million American children are growing up with a parent behind bars--other states have also revisited mandatory-minimum sentence laws, increased use of parole, and placed drug offenders in treatment instead of prison. Several states have also decriminalized recreational use of marijuana (most recently, Washington and Colorado)--another indication that harsh drug sentences are falling out of favor.</p> <p>The U. S. Congress has reduced crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparities (a contributor to the racial disparity in incarceration), and the Second Chance Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008, funds rehabilitative services for prisoners, such as reentry programs, prison education, and drug treatment, as well as research on the effectiveness of those services. More than $250 million has been awarded under the act so far--tiny compared to the combined state and federal prison budget of $75 billion annually, but an encouraging sign, says Western.</p> <p>Economic concerns remain the most persuasive argument in driving prison reform. But Western has an even more compelling argument: locking up more Americans, he asserts, has not greatly reduced crime. After peaking in the early 1990s, the U. S. homicide rate fell throughout the rest of the decade, and has remained relatively low since then. The rates of other violent crimes and property crimes fell precipitously, too.</p> <p>Western concludes that nine-tenths of this drop in crime would have occurred without any increase in the incarceration rate. He points to increased police spending and presence as a major contributor (more and better policing keeps crime down even if people aren't being sent to prison). The trend may also represent regression to the mean after a historic high. He notes that crime dropped in Europe, Canada, and Latin America during the same period, even though incarceration rates in those places did not have the same steep upward slope. What's more, New York maintained very low crime rates throughout the first decade of this century even as it shrank its prison population.</p> <p>Because it is impossible to say how many crimes a given individual would hypothetically commit if free instead of imprisoned, such analyses necessarily rely on comparisons and statistical assumptions. Western's conclusion is controversial, and other scholars have obtained different answers to the same question--notably, a widely cited analysis by University of Chicago economist and Freakonomics author Steven D. Levitt '89, JF '97, who observed what happened in 12 states after large numbers of prisoners were released from overcrowded facilities under court order. The two scholars essentially disagree about the statistical assumptions underlying their calculations: Western does not believe one can generalize from the specific situation Levitt used to generate his assumptions; Levitt stands by his claim that locking more people up was the major driver of the 1990s drop in crime. But even Levitt recently told The New York Times that he believes that the trend has gone too far and the prison population should shrink ""by at least one-third.""</p> <p>Western has helped lead two national task forces on the causes and consequences of mass incarceration. Now he is embarking on an action-oriented initiative, convening leaders from law enforcement, lawmaking, the judiciary, public policy, and substance-abuse and vocational services--as well as some former inmates--for a series of meetings at the Kennedy School during the next three years. Their goal: to overcome the political gridlock that has inhibited major criminal-justice reform in America.</p> <p>Some say the ""prison-industrial complex""--those who work at prisons, sell goods to prisons, and benefit from cheap prisoner labor--has become a large and powerful lobby that prevents change. Western believes this argument is ""oversold,"" and the real explanation is simpler: for all the dissatisfaction with the amount of money spent on prisons, tough-on-crime arguments are still popular. ""If the crime rate drops, people say, 'see, prisons work. We have to spend more money on them,'"" explains Marieke Liem. Conversely, ""If the crime rate rises, people say, 'We have to spend more money on prisons.'"" Western seeks to broaden the options.</p> <p>One example: services for youths who have not yet committed crimes. Anthony Braga, who has studied gang violence extensively, says the average gang comprises about 30 young men, but ""only five or six are what I would call truly dangerous; the rest of the kids are what we call situationally dangerous. They recognize that there is the potential to be doing something better with their lives. If you can work with those kids, you can make a big impact.""</p> <p>Helping divert youths from the path to prison may help stem the tide of urban violence and heal communities suffering from the absence of husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons. ""The prison walls we built with such industry in the 1980s and '90s did not keep out the criminal predators,"" Western writes, ""but instead divided us internally, leaving our poorest communities with fewer opportunities to join the mainstream and deeply skeptical of the institutions charged with their safety.""</p> <p>Breaking this cycle is a tall order, but keeping people out of prison is clearly preferable to trying to help them once they're already there. The prison experience shreds social ties with the outside world, leaving inmates with convicted criminals as their only friends. Prison also gets them out of the habit of getting up and going to work each day--Western often refers to employment as a means of social control. And prison decimates former inmates' employment prospects. When someone can't get a job and his social circle consists of other criminals, making money through criminal activity--i.e., recidivism--becomes his most likely path.</p> <p>Western does not believe it is a coincidence that when social-welfare programs were trimmed throughout the 1970s and 1980s, large increases in crime ensued. ""We may have skimped on welfare, but we paid anyway, splurging on police and prisons,"" he writes. ""Dollars diverted from education and employment found their way to prison construction."" Assistant professor of sociology and social studies Matthew Desmond agrees, noting, for example, that the United States serves a smaller segment of its population with public housing than do most European countries--but makes up for it in spending on prisons, which are used as de facto public housing. Says Desmond: ""We're going to house the poor one way or another.""</p> <p>Liem, a practicing forensic psychologist in the Netherlands who first came to Boston in 2009, was struck by the way American inmates are ""treated as subhuman."" That they wear jumpsuits and are referred to by number instead of name; that sex offenders are made to register publicly; that felons in some states lose their voting rights for life--all contribute to a ""sense of otherness,"" she says. ""This idea that once you made a mistake and forever you have to pay for it is striking."" She suggests that instead it is possible to have compassion for both the victim and the perpetrator. For his part, Braga says he understands public opposition to services for convicted criminals, especially for violent offenders. But, he says, ""if we're trying to reduce overall levels of victimization, it seems like you'd want to do something that makes it less likely that people are going to continue committing crimes.""</p> <p>Western estimates that the cost of providing job placement, transitional housing, and drug treatment for all released prisoners who need it would be $7 billion--one-tenth of current state and federal spending on corrections. He has been disappointed that the Obama administration has not taken a stronger stand on prison reform. ""We're still in an era where being soft on crime carries political risk,"" he notes, but he has fresh hopes for the president's second term.</p> <p>Earlier in his career, Western, the son of a sociology professor at the University of Queensland, Australia, wrote about labor markets and statistical models for sociology. A chance conversation with a colleague prompted him to reenvision prisons as a ""labor-market institution"": he became aware that people who would receive vocational, substance-abuse, and mental-health services in many European countries are incarcerated instead in the United States. His scholarly work then proceeded in a new direction.</p> <p>Examining prisons' role vis-a-vis U. S. labor markets, Western found that the United States owes its (historically) comparatively low unemployment rate in part to its high incarceration rate: people who would otherwise be unemployed are excluded from the calculations. He has also documented the reduction in pay suffered by people with a prison record, compared to their peers with no record, and how incarceration contributes to income inequality in the United States by condemning some people to very low pay. He has explored the interconnectedness of race, lack of employment opportunity, and incarceration (finding, in research with his former Princeton colleague Devah Pager, that a black man without a criminal record had about the same chance of being called after applying for a job as a white man with a criminal record). And he found that the high incarceration rate had the perverse effect of seeming to raise the average wage for African-American men: because so many low-earning African-American men are in prison, racial equality in pay is more apparent than real.</p> <p>During his time on the faculty at Princeton, he first ventured inside a correctional facility to teach a sociology course for incarcerated men. For someone who ""had spent most of my career crunching numbers on a computer and teaching Ivy League students,"" Western remembers, that experience was ""unbelievably powerful.""</p> <p>Since coming to Harvard in 2007, he has worked with Kaia Stern, a lecturer in ethics at Harvard Divinity School, to take groups of undergraduates into Massachusetts state prisons for courses on urban sociology. The Harvard students learn alongside inmates who are also pursuing bachelor's degrees--and in the process, learn to view issues of crime and punishment in a more nuanced way. Because of this experience, Western, a married father of three daughters, has gained empathy for Jerry and others who have committed violent crimes. ""Often we want to say that people in prison are criminal and evil and unredeemable, or that they're innocent and victims of circumstance,"" says Western. ""The truth is that they're neither of those things. You can do some very terrible things in your life and yet be deeply human at the same time.""</p>","Yes"

(Muhammed Muheisen/AP)</p> <p>One cleric is a wanted terrorist who preaches that the United States is Pakistan's worst enemy, determined to ""wipe out every Muslim"" with the help of his other nemesis, the Jews. His name is Hafiz Mohammad Saeed.</p> <p>The other cleric fondly recalls his years in the United States, where he drove a Chevy Suburban and allied himself with a prominent rabbi to promote religious tolerance. His name is Hafiz Muhammad Masood.</p> <p>Masood, 54, and Saeed, 62, are brothers. Their conspicuously different paths illustrate the often contradictory nature of Pakistan itself, a country that behaves like both friend and foe to its chief patron, the United States -- frequently at the same time.</p> <p>As much as Pakistanis are said to loathe U. S. policies, many eagerly seek opportunities for themselves and their children in the United States. Masood was one of them, spending 21 years in the Boston area.</p> <p>Today he is the spokesman for the Lahore-based religious charity that his brother heads, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, or Party of Truth. The United States calls it a terrorist front group tied to the 2008 attacks in Mumbai and has offered $10 million for evidence leading to Saeed's arrest or conviction. Masood has denied the accusations.</p> <p>Unlike his fiery-tongued brother, Masood displays a calm, good-humored nature. He has an easy command of American idioms, such as ""one size fits all"" and ""this is a no-no.""</p> <p>Masood returned to Pakistan only grudgingly, after pleading guilty in 2008 to visa-related violations. He left behind his comfortable job as an imam at the Islamic Center of New England, as well as his wife and eight children.</p> <p>""Believe me, I love American life, and for many aspects,"" Masood said contemplatively, sitting in a quiet room across the courtyard from the capacious two-level mosque where his elder brother delivers his rants against the United States, India and Israel. ""People are very logical, they are very open, and I found the Islamic work very, very enjoyable in American society.""</p> <p>The world knows much about Saeed and the other U. S.-designated terrorist group he founded: Lashkar-i-Taiba, or Army of the Pious. Officials say Lashkar-i-Taiba carried out the three-day attack in Mumbai -- killing 166 people, including six Americans -- and is responsible for several other deadly operations against India. The $10 million reward puts Saeed in the same top-tier terrorist category as fugitive Taliban chief Mohammad Omar.</p> <p>Far fewer have heard of Masood, whose 15-year tenure at the Islamic center in Sharon, Mass., won him praise for outreach to other faiths. His supporters, including members of a local synagogue, said the immigration case stemmed from anti-Muslim bias.</p> <p>""He was a positive influence on the community, and I didn't think it made a whole lot of sense to deport him,"" said Rabbi Barry Starr of Temple Israel in Sharon. ""I found him to be a gentleman, a gentle person, a person of peace.""</p> <p>In Masood's view, the case against him represented classic guilt by association. ""When they want to find something on you, they will,"" he said with a hearty laugh.</p> <p>In lengthy conversations, Masood, a stocky man with a chest-length beard, rarely seemed angry or bitter, even though he gave up everything he had worked to achieve in the United States: His family, a five-bedroom house on five acres, three cars, a lovely garden and access to the swimming pool and tennis courts on the Islamic center's grounds.</p> <p>""I lost my worldly life,"" Masood said. ""I lost that for good.""</p> <p>""Hafiz"" is a title bestowed on those who have memorized the entire Koran. Saeed, Masood and their younger brother, Hamid Mahmood, all earned that distinction, as have their two sisters.</p> <p>Their father was a farmer, Islamic teacher and respected village elder. ""He did conflict resolution,"" Masood said.</p> <p>Their mother ran a religious school for children. With her prodding, Masood learned the Koran by heart by age 10.</p> <p>In 1965, war broke out between Pakistan and India over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. It soon touched the family's village, about 120 miles west of Lahore.</p> <p>Actually, there was no fighting there; it was wartime paranoia.</p> <p>Rumors flew that Indian spies might infiltrate the village. Their target: the nearby Pakistani air force base at Sargodha. The teenage Saeed grew convinced that Indian paratroopers might land in the vicinity.</p> <p>He organized a group of boys -- 30 or 40 of them -- to stay awake all night, brandishing sticks to guard the village, he recently told a Pakistani newspaper.</p> <p>""I still remember that the boys were fully charged,"" recalled Masood, who was 7 at the time. Their leader instructed them to beat the bushes looking for Indians and ""any suspicious activity.""</p> <p>Did they ever catch any spies?</p> <p>As young men, Masood and Saeed earned advanced degrees in Pakistan and became professors. The elder brother focused on Islamic studies and Arabic literature, while Masood's specialty was Islamic economics.</p> <p>The younger brother's path led him to the United States on a student visa in 1987. He took his wife and five small children, enrolling first at Vanderbilt for a semester, then earning his bachelor's and master's degrees in economic policy at Boston University.</p> <p>Saeed went in a different direction. His advanced scholarship took him to Saudi Arabia, where he studied in the early 1980s under the same teacher who once instructed Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>After supporting the fight to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan, Saeed in 1990 established Lashkar-i-Taiba to target Indian troops in Kashmir. For years, Pakistan's main intelligence service backed Lashkar-i-Taiba as a proxy against India.</p> <p>Official support ended when then-President Pervez Musharraf banned the group in the months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But it has still enjoyed tacit sanction.</p> <p>After the ban, Saeed disassociated himself from the militant group and said it no longer exists. Instead he runs Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which many investigators describe as a benign facade behind which Saeed has tucked Lashkar-i-Taiba. But there is no denying that it has earned goodwill across Pakistan for its schools, anti-poverty programs and health clinics, as well as its relief work for flood and earthquake victims.</p> <p>Saeed has been periodically placed under house arrest but never convicted of any crimes. He has insisted that he has no connection to Lashkar-i-Taiba.</p> <p>As for the Mumbai attacks, Saeed was exonerated by Pakistan's Supreme Court, which declared that ""the India lobby"" concocted the charges.</p> <p>In gentler tones, Masood echoes his brother's accusations that India, with U. S. help, is scheming to dominate Afghanistan as a way to intimidate Pakistan. He also calls the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan illegal and imperialistic.</p> <p>Muhammad Amir Rana, an expert on extremism here, said that Jamaat-ud-Dawa is trying to establish a different identity and build a political base, but that it retains its militant links.</p> <p>The group has made clear that it opposes attacks within Pakistan and condemned the Pakistani Taliban's recent shooting of the young education activist Malala Yousafzai. But no matter how mild Masood comes across, Rana said, he still represents an extremist group that is ""the new far right in Pakistan.""</p> <p>The United States has long expressed irritation at Pakistan's refusal to hand over Saeed. Pakistani officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the matter has recently died down, with the United States putting greater focus on the Haqqani terrorist network, which is based in Pakistan's tribal areas. The U. S. Embassy in Islamabad would not comment on Saeed.</p> <p>After his studies in Boston, Masood joined the suburban Islamic center, where he inherited a fractious congregation of 3,000 Muslims of various nations and beliefs -- Sunnis and Shiites, liberals and hard-liners.</p> <p>He is remembered particularly fondly in the Jewish community: Once, when Nazi swastikas were painted on a local temple, the imam and members of his mosque helped remove them.</p> <p>Masood also introduced a course for interested locals called Islam 101. He said he converted hundreds of people to the faith.</p> <p>In October 2006, the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan coincided with the Jewish High Holy Days. Members of Starr's synagogue and Masood's mosque came together for prayers and the breaking of the Muslims' daylight-hours fast.</p> <p>Six weeks later, Masood found himself in jail, caught up in an eight-state dragnet in which the federal government accused him and 32 others of immigration-law violations.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, it turned out, Masood had violated the terms of his student visa because he had not returned to his native country for two years as required. And, while pursuing permanent residency, he had lied on documents by saying that he had.</p> <p>Masood fought the charges, determined to remain in Sharon, but finally admitted to them. Facing certain deportation, he left the country the day after entering a plea deal.</p> <p>During questioning, Masood said, federal agents attempted to draw links between him and his older brother. He said they had no relationship and didn't communicate.</p> <p>""Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Lashkar-i-Taiba formed in my absence,"" Masood said. ""I read about them in the newspaper.""</p> <p>The former U. S. attorney in Boston, Michael Sullivan, said the case against Masood was rooted in visa fraud and nothing more. ""It was not an investigation opened up because of guilt by association,"" he said.</p> <p>Masood is convinced that he will never be allowed to return to the United States, where his wife and five children who were born in Pakistan are fighting deportation. (His three other children are U. S. citizens.)</p> <p>""Even if they allowed me, they would always suspect me as"" -- he curves his fingers to form air quotes -- "" 'a terrorist,' as 'an extremist,' 'brother of Hafiz Saeed.' ""</p> <p>Today, besides heading his brother's media wing, he runs a separate mosque and religious school. He isn't paid, he said, although the congregation provides him a home. He supports himself through a small embroidery business.</p> <p>""I have a very humble car,"" he said -- a 10-year-old Toyota Corolla.</p> <p>He took a second wife, as is permissible under Islam, and has since had another son, who is 2. ""I started my family from scratch again,"" he said.</p> <p>William Joyce, who formerly represented Masood and his family, said the case's outcome left the imam with few options. ""He was sent back with no particular way to survive,"" Joyce said.</p> <p>The lawyer speculated that that might have driven Masood to begin working with his brother.</p> <p>But Masood cited a different reason. ""I thought to myself: I cannot have again as good a life as I had in America,"" he said. ""So what is left to me is only the hereafter. So the rest of my life is used for service to people. Maybe I will earn something from God.""</p> <p>The muezzin gave the call for late-afternoon prayer, and the men of Jamaat-ud-Dawa began to filter back to the mosque. Inside, a few hours earlier, Saeed had delivered a trademark sermon. He assured his listeners: ""The ultimate end of the United States and the West is near, and Islam will completely dominate the lands of the world.""</p> <p>He denounced the U. S. ""trick of interfaith harmony.""</p> <p>And he said: ""We know that the Jews are behind all these conspiracies.""</p> <p>The muezzin's call faded. Masood excused himself politely and went to pray.</p>","Yes"

He agreed to bound by these decisions, no matter how absurd, and to broadcast the results online for the wider world to see.</p> <p>For the entire month, with the backing of the New York-based public art organization Creative Time, Marc has been crowdsourcing his life. Everything from what he should wear to how he should celebrate Thanksgiving is open to the masses. The piece continues in the tradition of Marc's extensive body of enormously popular Internet-based works, from ""Talkshow 247,"" where he broadcast his life continuously for three months, and the ""Google Maps Roadtrip,"" a journey across the country using only Google Streetview.</p> <p>For ""The Advice of Strangers,"" his most recent piece, he's making the connection even more explicit: anyone can follow along, anyone can vote on his dilemmas and questions, and he's bound to our advice. An engaged electorate, we contribute, we comment and then we let Marc deal with the consequences.</p> <p>What happens this morning is pizza, and the pizza is part of a B movie Marc is filming with his crew per the vote. Marc is very much the embodiment of his online persona: immediately disarming, goofy, and not a little frenetic. He grabs the pizza, sets it down and returns to his motley crew. He's in the midst of receiving a hair cut for the movie, and his interns -- two 15-year old girls recruited that day from a Craigslist ad -- are hammering out the remainder of the day's script.</p> <p>We spend the rest of the day in his apartment in Highland Park, a small neighborhood in northern Los Angeles that's recently become hip. Marc and his crew sing songs in gibberish, don upside down sunglasses and play Foosball, pick up Marc's underwear and even stage a fight with fake blood oozing out of Marc's mouth. Marc's in-house production team films his life and edits it for his popular Advice of Strangers YouTube Channel, and he works with a programmer to make sure the website and corresponding iPhone app function properly.</p> <p>Whether it's high art or juvenile self indulgence, it doesn't matter: we voted for this. In the midst of the project, some 54% of his followers asked that the project be entertaining, and a few days later, Marc's project started receiving as many as 1,444 votes on each question.</p> <p>""The comments have been amazing,"" he mentions between takes. ""People have been very supportive, and I base a lot of my questions on the comments.""</p> <p>Indeed, comments range from encouraging him to drink less and exercise more (""You look like your 44!"") to reminding him to ""Go to class and do something hilarious but good!""</p> <p>But not everyone is a fan of the project. ""It's been really tough on me,"" Marc tells me over cigarettes during a reflective moment. He had to take down a video of his therapy appointment upon his mother's request (he said things about her she didn't want aired in public), and he tells me that his graduate program has been less than supportive that he's had to take so much time away from class and studio work to focus on the month-long project.</p> <p>""But every now and then,"" he says, ""someone has to shake things up in the art world."" Out of the average artist's mouth, this might come across as arrogant or presumptuous. But coming from Marc, it sounds earnest, even endearing: he genuinely wants to engage arts audiences in a new way, one that ultimately is more engaging and exciting for a generation raised with more active media like YouTube and Flickr.</p> <p>""The next logical step in crowdsourcing,"" he continues, ""is to crowdsource your life. At the core of the artist's work is decision making. Making that public is what makes this project different.""</p> <p>Even when he's not subjecting his actions to the voting booth, he's subjecting them to those around him. His every moment is interspersed with ""What should I do here?"" and ""What do you think?"" Even his B movie, Extra Rinse or No Extra Rinse 2, is titled as a question of options.</p> <p>Ultimately, whether the work is successful is as much up to the audience as it is to Marc. Though he chooses the range of options for each question -- ""I don't want people to tell me to go shave my head and have sex with a lamb"" -- the outcome of the work relies on the audience.</p> <p>""The web predominately feels like the Wild West right now. It's a place of populace,"" Marc says of his larger experiments in online-based art. ""I have to speak to that. I have a hard time justifying this work, and people ask me what I'm doing with this project.""</p> <p>He takes a puff of his cigarette. I didn't ask him to do that, nor did his audience vote on this action. Our entire conversation is happening without their knowledge.</p> <p>""Is it entertaining or not?"" he asks. ""Am I a cultural producer or a cultural critic? I don't know. I don't fit in anywhere.""</p> <p>The work, so reliant on votes, has turned art into a democracy. Like a democracy, the choice exists, but it's limited to only a few options. And like a real democracy, it's not clear who to blame if the work sours or who to praise if it's successful. If I don't like the way things are being done, do I blame the idiots who voted against me? Or is it my fault for not rallying my friends to action?</p> <p>If Marc the artist can be credited for success in this piece, it will be for his on-screen charisma and in-person charm and the particular way he phrases his questions and posts the results. It's addicting to check in, see what he has to say, and watch how he deals with the utter absurdity of a life at the hands of others.</p>","Yes"

He accrued over 715 hours, and had seen a total of 269 sunrises from space, on his Gemini and Apollo flights. This was a personal record that stood until the Skylab 3 mission in July through September 1973.","Apollo 13's flight trajectory gives Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the record for the farthest distance that humans have ever traveled from Earth.","<p>On April 12, 1961, humanity became a spacefaring species when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin blasted into orbit on a 108-minute flight high above Earth.</p> <p>So Gagarin set the original record -- first person in space. But over the years, people have notched many other records as our species has extended its toehold in the cold depths of space. [Countdown: Top Milestones of Human Spaceflight]</p> <p>Here's a look at some of these marks, from the oldest person in space to the most consecutive days spent away from terra firma.</p> <p>Gagarin was the first person to fly in space, and the first American followed only a few weeks later. Alan Shepard blasted off on Freedom 7 on May 5, 1961.</p> <p>The first female in space was Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian cosmonaut, who flew in space in June 1963. There were several other female cosmonauts selected with her, but none of the others flew. The next woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, didn't fly until 1982. The first American woman in space was Sally Ride, who reached space on June 18, 1983 as part of space shuttle mission STS-7.</p> <p>For almost 20 years, the Americans and the Soviets were the only nations with astronauts. The first nation outside of those two countries to fly an astronaut was the former Czechoslovakia, which saw Vladimir Remek fly on the Soviet Soyuz 28 mission in 1978. Since then, dozens of nations from all over the world have seen their citizens fly in space on American, Soviet or Russian spacecraft.</p> <p>U. S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, was 77 when he flew on space shuttle Discovery's STS-95 mission in October 1998. The mission marked Glenn's second spaceflight; he had become the first American to orbit the Earth back in February 1962.</p> <p>So Glenn holds another record as well: the longest time between trips to space (36 years 8 months).</p> <p>The oldest woman in space was Peggy Whitson, who was 57 years old during her last flight (Expeditions 50, 51 and 52 in 2016-2017).</p> <p>Cosmonaut Gherman Titov was a month shy of his 26th birthday when he launched into orbit aboard the Soviet spacecraft Vostok 2 in August 1961. He was the second person to orbit the Earth, performing 17 loops around our planet during his 25-hour flight.</p> <p>Titov was also the first person to sleep in space, and reportedly the first to suffer from ""space sickness"" (motion sickness in space).</p> <p>Tereshkova was not only the first woman in space, but also the youngest - her record of 26 years still stands today.</p> <p>Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov spent nearly 438 consecutive days aboard the Mir space station, from January 1994 to March 1995. He therefore holds the record for longest single human spaceflight -- and perhaps set another one for wobbliest legs when he finally touched down.</p> <p>The most consecutive days in space by an American is 340 days, which happened when Scott Kelly took part in a one-year mission to the International Space Station in 2015-16 (along with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko).</p> <p>The longest single flight by a woman took place in 2016-17, when American astronaut Peggy Whitson spent more than 289 days aboard the space station.</p> <p>Alan Shepard, on May 5, 1961, became the first American in space. Shepard's suborbital flight in NASA's Freedom 7 vehicle lasted just 15 minutes, carrying him to an altitude of 115 miles (185 km). He splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean just 302 miles (486 km) downrange of his Florida launch site.</p> <p>Shepard would later get more than this tiny taste of space experience. In 1971, he went to the moon on NASA's Apollo 14 mission. During that flight, the 47-year-old astronaut set another record, becoming the oldest person to walk the surface of another world.</p> <p>The record for the greatest distance from Earth has stood for more than four decades. In April 1970, the crew of NASA's Apollo 13 mission swung around the far side of the moon at an altitude of 158 miles (254 km), putting them 248,655 miles (400,171 km) away from Earth. It's the farthest our species has ever been from our home planet.</p> <p>Cosmonaut Gennady Padalka holds this record, with a little more than 878 days accrued over five spaceflights. That's almost two and a half years (2 years 4 months 3 weeks 5 days) spent zipping around the Earth at about 17,500 mph (28,164 kph).</p> <p>For women, the record is held by NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who spent more than 665 days in space. That also happens to be the endurance record for any American astronaut.</p> <p>This record belongs to the International Space Station, and it grows every day. The $100 billion orbiting lab has been continuously occupied since Nov. 2, 2000. [Infographic: The International Space Station - Inside and Out]</p> <p>This span of time -- plus two days, since the first station crew launched Oct. 31, 2000 -- also marks the longest period of continuous human presence in space.</p> <p>The space shuttle Columbia launched on its STS-80 mission on Nov. 19, 1996. It was originally slated to return to Earth that Dec. 5, but bad weather pushed the landing back two days. When Columbia finally came home, it had spent nearly 17 days and 16 hours in space -- a record for a shuttle mission. [Most Memorable Space Shuttle Missions]</p> <p>In December 1972, Harrison Schmidt and Eugene Cernan of NASA's Apollo 17 mission spent just under 75 hours -- more than three days -- poking around on the surface of the moon. They also performed three moonwalks that lasted a total of more than 22 hours.</p> <p>Perhaps the astronauts lingered because they suspected humanity wouldn't be back for a while -- Apollo 17 marked the last time people traveled to the moon, or even went beyond low-Earth orbit.</p> <p>Incidentally, the first moonwalk took place on July 20, 1969, during Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong stepped outside of the Eagle lunar module. He was shortly followed by his crewmate Buzz Aldrin. The moonwalk lasted a little over 2 hours, 31 minutes -- about the same length of a typical Hollywood movie.</p> <p>The crew of NASA's Apollo 10 moon mission reached a top speed of 24,791 mph (39,897 kph) relative to Earth as they rocketed back to our planet on May 26, 1969. That's the fastest any human beings have ever traveled. [Video: Apollo 10: Full Dress Moon Rehearsal]</p> <p>The Apollo 10 mission served as a dress rehearsal for NASA's first moon landing two months later, on July 20, 1969.</p> <p>Apollo 10 astronauts Cernan, John Young and Tom Stafford orbited the moon in their command module Charlie Brown and Lunar Module Snoopy. Later, Stafford and Cernan took the Snoopy lunar lander down to within 50,000 feet (15,243 meters) of the moon's surface before returning to dock with the Charlie Brown module.</p> <p>This one is shared by two NASA astronauts. Franklin Chang-Diaz and Jerry Ross both went to space seven times aboard NASA's space shuttles. Chang-Diaz made his flights between 1986 and 2002, while Ross made his between 1985 and 2002.</p> <p>The first-ever spacewalk was performed by Alexei Leonov, who performed a 12-minute spacewalk during Voshkod 2 on March 18, 1965. The astronaut later said that he had trouble getting back inside the spacecraft (his spacesuit ballooned) and that he also was close to getting heatstroke, but he made it back home safely.</p> <p>The first American spacewalk was performed by Ed White on June 3, 1965. The first spacewalk by a woman wasn't for nearly 20 years afterwards, when Svetlana Savitskaya performed a spacewalk on July 25, 1984, outside of the Salyut 7 space station. The first American woman to perform a spacewalk was Kathryn Sullivan, who left space shuttle Challenger on Oct. 11, 1984.</p> <p>The first untethered spacewalk (one of only a handful performed) happened on Feb. 7, 1984, when Bruce McCandless used the Manned Maneuvering Unit to move away from space shuttle Challenger during mission STS-41-B.</p> <p>Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev made 16 spacewalks over the course of five missions in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>Solovyev spent more than 82 hours outside his spacecraft on those excursions -- another record. [The Top 10 Soviet and Russian Science Missions]</p> <p>U. S. astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria has an American record of 10 spacewalks, with a total time spent outside of 67 hours 40 minutes. Close behind is the woman to make the most spacewalks; American astronaut Peggy Whitson, performed 10 spacewalks over several missions for a total time of 60 hours 21 minutes.</p> <p>On March 11, 2001, NASA astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms spent 8 hours and 56 minutes outside the space shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station during the STS-102 mission, performing some maintenance work and preparing the orbiting lab for the arrival of another module.</p> <p>It may sound unlucky, but the record for the largest human gathering in space stands at 13 - which was set during NASA's STS-127 shuttle mission aboard Endeavour in 2009.</p> <p>In July 2009, Endeavour docked with the International Space Station. The shuttle's seven-person crew then went aboard the orbiting lab, joining the six spaceflyers already there. The 13-person party was the largest-ever gathering of people in space at the same time.</p> <p>While subsequent NASA shuttle and station crews matched the 13-person record, it has never been topped.</p> <p>This record stands at four women in orbit at the same time.</p> <p>In April 2010, NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson traveled to the International Space Station in a Russian Soyuz spaceship. She was soon joined on the orbiting lab by NASA astronauts Stephanie Wilson and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger and Japan's Naoko Yamazaki, who made the trip aboard the space shuttle Discovery on its STS-131 mission.</p> <p>Member nations began building the International Space Station -- which is about as long as a football field and boasts as much living space as a five-bedroom house -- back in 1998. It was completed in 2012, although more expansions are in store.</p> <p>The cost for the orbiting lab was estimated at $100 billion in 2011. That makes the station the single most expensive structure ever built. The cost will continue to rise due to more modules and time operating the station.</p> <p>Once again, the International Space Station is the winner.</p> <p>The orbiting lab is the product of five space agencies representing more than 15 countries. From one end of its backbone-like main truss to the other, it measures about 357.5 feet (109 meters) across. There are huge solar arrays at each end of the truss, and they have a wingspan of 239.4 feet (73 m).</p> <p>Astronauts live inside a series of connected, pressurized modules that are attached to the main truss. These modules have a habitable space roughly equivalent to the interior cabin of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The station is currently staffed by six astronauts, but that population has jumped to between nine and 13 people when a visiting vehicle -- like a Russian Soyuz or fully crewed NASA shuttle -- was docked.</p> <p>The space station is so large that it can easily be seen by the unaided eye from the ground if skywatchers have clear skies and know where to look. The station appears as a fast-moving bright light that can outshine the brightest star (Sirius) or Venus, depending on viewing conditions.</p> <p>Follow Space.com senior writer Mike Wall on Twitter: @michaeldwall.

such as Google or Amazon could transform the market.","<p>Pensions Minister Ros Altmann has said outside players such as Amazon, Google or Facebook could take the pensions market by storm.</p> <p>Speaking to the Financial Times, Altmann said she believes ""outside disruptive players"" will enter the market, as current pension providers have become ""far too complacent"".</p> <p>The Minister thinks the introduction of auto-enrolment has increased the problem; since 2012, over five million people have been auto-enrolled in workplace pensions, with millions more expected over the next two years.</p> <p>""Pension companies previously didn't engage with the end customer at all. They would sit there, waiting for a salesman to bring them the customer's money[...]And so they designed products that the salesmen could sell rather than those customers actually needed,"" she said.</p> <p>However, Altmann stated that auto-enrolment means the government is ""ensuring that millions of people are coming to the pensions industry without the needs for a salesman."" As a result, she said pension providers need to take a different approach to designing products and think about what is good for savers.</p> <p>""I don't think many people would argue that this was the case before. And certainly some of the issues that are being uncovered by the regulatory review of asset managers and what we know from past pensions scandals would suggest there is more the industry can be doing to treat customers well,"" she stated.</p> <p>Altmann said that she has no problem with companies making a profit but they must treat people fairly whilst achieving this.</p> <p>""If providers don't grasp this opportunity, don't make the most of the opportunities provided by auto-enrolment, don't treat customers well, then some disruptive outside players will. Other people will surely arrive because there is so much money at stake. In 2014, PS80bn went into pensions. By 2020 it will be closer to PS100bn.</p> <p>""We don't know who will come in yet because it hasn't happened. It could be somebody we have never heard of who takes the market by storm, but it could also be Amazon, Google or Facebook,"" she stated.</p> <p>The head of Amazon China Doug Gurr has recently been appointed to the board of the Department for Work and Pensions as a non-executive director. Altmann was asked whether she has spoken to the companies about their interest in pensions, and said: ""I can't talk about that"".</p>","Yes"

He was selected as the 1992 First Team Goalkeeper  In addition to his outdoor career, Andracki spent several seasons playing indoor soccer. In September 1992, the Milwaukee Wave selected Andracki in the first round (ninth overall) of the National Professional Soccer League draft. A month later, the Wave traded Andracki, Tim Bartro and Mark Kerlin to the Cleveland Crunch in exchange for David Vaudreuil. Andracki spent three seasons with the Crunch, winning the 1994 NPSL championship with them. When the Rowdies folded following the 1993 season, Andracki moved to the Atlanta Magic of the USISL mid way through the 1994 season. In 1995, he moved to the Atlanta Ruckus of the A-League.","In June 1995, the Tampa Bay Terror selected Andracki in the NPSL Expansion Draft.","<p>With the long awaited and surprisingly successful debut of Major League Soccer, plus the US Women's triumph at the Olympics, 1996 was a banner year for American soccer. Major League Soccer got off to a much better start than even the most optimistic forecasts had predicted, and the Women's National Team triumphed, at the Olympics, winning the gold for the first ever women's soccer competition. Meanwhile, the USL began its drive for Division 2 recognition by establishing the Select League, and the Men's National Team started training in earnest for the 1998 World Cup. With the return of Division 1 soccer to the United States, a local domestic league was in place to give American players an unprecedented opportunity to not only gain top level playing experience, but to do so for hometown crowds. No longer would US players have to settle for Division II competition if they weren't good enough to be one of the few players able to secure overseas positions in Europe.</p> <p>Major League Soccer made its long awaited debut this year. As stated above, the season was widely successful, better than most predictions. The success was most profound at the gate; league officials had hoped to draw 8,000-10,000 fans per game and build up from there, but based on the huge crowds in the first weeks, the league averaged over 17,000. Weak spots showed up early and would prove to be major concerns as the year passed.</p> <p>Competitively, the league showed how much was left to be accomplished, but the quality of play improved steadily as the season wore on and the teams gelled and players became familiar with each other and the coaches settled on playing styles. Pundits generally described the teams as fitting in somewhere around the middle of the 2nd division of the Spanish and English leagues. Attendance-wide, the US was ahead of all but the traditional four powerhouses in Europe, England, Germany, Italy and Spain, and comparable to the French 1st division. The US surprised everyone with the number of National Team members signed (the bulk of the player pool), but concerns were raised about whether the transfer of top players to MLS would hurt National team competitiveness. Which way to go? Give them competition overseas, or build up the MLS and allow them to get that experience at home? Only time would tell.</p> <p>The major tasks at hand for MLS at the start of 1996 were to finalize the player pool for the inaugural draft. They kicked off by filling the final three coaching vacancies, hiring Eddie Firmani to coach the MetroStars on January 3, followed later by Bruce Arena at D. C. United, and Frank Stapleton with the New England Revolution. Carlos Valderrama was assigned to Tampa Bay Mutiny. Fifteen more players were added to the player pool, including National Team star Leonel Alvarez of Colombia. On January 5, the Player Combine was held in Irvine, CA, with all 250 non-allocated player in the player pool showing their stuff to the coaches for ten days. During the combine, Roy Lassiter was allocated to Tampa Bay Mutiny, and Eric Wynalda went to the Dallas Burn.</p> <p>During the rest of January, several other player allocations were made, including Marco Etchevarry to D. C. United, Brian Bliss to the Columbus Crew, Digital Takawira to the Kansas City Wiz, and Uruguayan Adrian Paz to Columbus. On February 5, just one day before the player draft, MLS scored a coup in signing Marcelo Balboa, the US Team Captain and all-time appearance leader, as well as World Cup Italian Star Roberto Donadoni. Balboa went to the Colorado Rapids, and Donadoni to the MetroStars. Ten more players were allocated, and on February 6, with the signing of Shaun Barlett, all 40 allocated positions had been filled. The draft occurred February 6-7, with 160 players selected. This was followed in early March with the college draft (40 players) and a Supplemental draft of free agents (another 40 players). This number would be brought down during training camps to a roster limit of 18 players per team (+ discovery players).</p> <p>The initial roster of MLS players was a varied group, coming from a variety of sources. Many players were from the A-League and USISL, with a liberal sprinkling of faces from the indoor National Professional Soccer League and Continental Indoor Soccer League. A number were fresh out of college (and would have a challenging time adjusting to the pro game), and a number came from foreign teams, US amateur clubs, and some were free agents. English and European team players were well represented, with such names as Ian Butterworth (Norwich, England), Brian McBride (Wolfsbger, Germany), Roy Wegerle (Coventry City), Adrian Paz (Ipswich Town), Paul Caligiuri (St. Pauli)Washington Ridriguez (Liverpool), John Harkes (Derby County), Frank Klopas (Apollon Athens), Nyanforth Peters (FC Locarno, Switz. ), Preki (Portsmouth, Engl. ), Brad Wilson (Saarbrucken), Donadoni (A. C. Milan), Ben Iroha (Vitesse Arnhem, Holland), Mike Burns (Viborg, Denmark), Peter Woodring (SV Wegen, Germany), Michael Emenlo (Notts County, Engl. ), Alexi Lalas (Padova, Italy), Steve Pittman (Partick Thistle, Scotland). A substantial number of players came from prominent Latin American clubs, including Boca Jr.'s, UNAM (Mexico), America of Brazil and UANL of Mexico. Sixty four players were current or former members of various national teams, and twenty two of those had World Cup experience, and better than 2/3 of the US National Team player pool was now with MLS. This bode well for the league's debut.</p> <p>Another major concern for many soccer fans was what rules would be implemented. MLS was known to be very interested in many of the rule changes and experiments being used by the USISL, including bonus points, shootout tie breakers with the player wall, blue cards, kick ins, 60 minute clocks with time stoppage, corner kick variations, and even wider goals had been discussed along with the USISL's 6-4-2-0+3 scoring system. Thankfully once the final rules were released, most of these experiments and ""innovations"" were passed over. The only changes to survive media scrutiny were a shootout (one on one) for tiebreakers, and a clock counting down.</p> <p>The scoring system was established as 3 points for a win, 1 for a shootout win and 0 for a loss. Soccer purists breathed a huge sigh of relief but there was grumbling about the MLS attitude that the game needed to be modified to suit US tastes, rather than the idea that soccer should be played the way the world plays it. This attitude would not change until Don Garber became commissioner of the league in 1999. Another hopeful sign was the MLS's operational decision to keep music and PA announcements to a very modest level, with no announcers or music during play, common annoyances during A-League, USISL and indoor games.</p> <p>Finally, shortly before the season MLS reached an agreement with the USISL to establish a developmental agreement, in effect establishing two farm clubs for each MLS team in which MLS players would be placed on USISL rosters for development and call-up. This system, similar to that with Major League Baseball in effect established the USISL as a minor league for MLS, and was a key development in establishing peace between the soccer leagues. MLS also reached an agreement with the indoor NPSL where players could play for both leagues, with the understanding that NPSL players would not join the MLS until after their indoor seasons were over. The same would apply in reverse at the playoff season of MLS. A less formal arrangement was made with the A-League (which became stronger the following seasonm when the A-League was absorbed by the USISL). They would not be actively competing for players. The CISL was also actively cooperating with the other leagues and USSF, although they did not participate in a formal players agreement with MLS because they also played in the summer during the MLS season.</p> <p>MLS made its debut on April 6, 1996 before a sold out crowd of 31,000+ at San Jose's Spartan Stadium via nationwide broadcast on ESPN. The game showed quickly the typical rough edges of a new league with players still learning their positions on the team. What could have been a disastrous debut was saved in the final seconds by an Eric Wynalda goal, as the San Jose Clash defeated D. C. United. The most notable element of the first two weeks were the surprisingly large crowds for team home openers, topped by 69,000 at Los Angeles. Although this tapered off rapidly, the crowds remained higher than expected, and the 1,000,000th fan passed the turnstiles on June 1.</p> <p>D. C. United's Steve Rammel scored the first MLS Hat trick on May 15 in a 5-2 victory over Columbus. Marco Etcheverry scored the first Assists ""hat trick"" in that same game. On June 16, the LA/Tampa Bay game was paired with the USA/Mexico USA Cup championship game to provide a record crowd of 92,216. Mexico won the Cup on a 2-2 draw, and the Galaxy defeated Tampa 3-2 in a shootout. The All-Star game on July 14 in East Rutherford New Jersey pitted East and West squads against each other in doubleheader with a FIFA charity event pitting the FIFA All-Stars against Brazil. This event, which established a Giants Stadium attendance record of 78,416, saw the East defeat the West, while Brazil defeated the All-Stars 2-1.</p> <p>Parity ruled in the league, at least in the Eastern Conference, as Tampa Bay pulled out a close divisional title over D. C. United, with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, Columbus and New England tied at the bottom, with shootout victories making the difference. Los Angeles won the West fairly easily, with the only team truly out of the running being the hapless Rapids. They and New England were the only teams out of the playoffs. Roy Lassiter won the scoring title with 27 goals and 58 points, followed by Eduardo Hurtado and Preki, and Raul Diaz Arce. One particularly gratifying result of this first season was the strong performance of the American players against the foreign allocations. Unlike the NASL, where the league was overrun by foreign stars and journeymen, with the Americans relegated mostly to the bench (despite the minimum American player limit). This time the Americans were guaranteed a majority of the starting positions.</p> <p>Of the top 20 scorers, ten were Americans. Goalkeeping, always an American strength was even more impressive, with nine of the top ten positions held by Americans. Los Angeles averaged an amazing 28,000 fans per game. TV ratings came in about what was planned for by ABC and ESPN, at about 1.5 per game. The MLS attendance surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, averaging 17,406 fans per game in the regular season for a total of 2,785,001. This far surpassed the best ever NASL seasons (1980) which averaged just under 15,000 fans per game. It should be noted however, that the NASL included twenty four teams, many poor performers during those years. Had the top ten teams been averaged (compared to the ten MLS teams), their average would have been just over 20,000 per game. An impressive result nevertheless, especially considering how many more major world stars and media hoopla the NASL enjoyed.</p> <p>The playoffs saw Tampa Bay, D. C. United, Kansas City and Los Angeles advance to the semifinals, where D. C. United began to show their dominance by dispatching Tampa Bay 4-1 and 2-1, while Los Angeles in a much closer series defeated Kansas City 2-1, 2-2 (3-1 shootout). The championship game, the first MLS Cup, was a memorable affair, not only as an exciting see-saw match with a very high level of play, but also because of the crowd. Foxboro Stadium had been pummeled by a tremendous downpour for over twelve hours, reeling under ten inches of pouring rain. Very little rain fell vertically, as the winds came close to gale force, and the temperature was only a few degrees above freezing. Despite the horrendous conditions, over 34,000 fans (out of 46,000 tickets sold) braved the weather and stuck it out through an exciting game.</p> <p>Eduardo Hurtado got the first goal in the 5th minute, and celebrated with a giant diving slide clear through one of the large puddles swamping the field. Chris Armas extended the score later, and it looked as if the game might be over. But D. C. United roared back as Tony Sanneh headed in a long Etcheverry free kick in the 73rd minute, followed by another Etcheverry free kick in the 82nd. The game went into overtime and Eddie Pope headed in the game winner off an Etcheverry corner kick. Many fans were already heading back to their cars by this time to avoid hypothermia, and heard the cheers, but had to get back to their car radios to find out who had won. D. C. United Captain John Harkes was awarded the newly-named Rothenberg Cup, while Etcheverry was named MVP.</p> <p>Many of the Sam's Army members who were active on the internet, formed their own mailing lists and supporters clubs for the various MLS teams. These supporters clubs worked with team management to secure their own sections in the stadium where they would stand and form loud and enthusiastic contingents, and stand, cheer, bang drums, sign, and try and get the rest of the crowds otherwise involved. They attracted considerable attention and added greatly to the stadium atmosphere, showing the powers that be that there are better ways than canned music to get the fans motivated. True to their collegial nature, the various supporters groups collaborated on ""The mother of all tailgates"", a grand tailgate party at Foxboro before the game in which supporters of all MLS teams joined together in a big good natured party to celebrate the successful birth of the league. Shortly after the end of the season, Kansas City mercifully changed their nickname to the Wizards.</p> <p>Official 1996 MLS Season Stats</p> <p>Original MLS rosters and player biographies</p> <p>Official MLS History Archives</p> <p>Fan-based MLS timeline from USA Soccer on the Net</p> <p>Dave Wilson's MLS Commentaries</p> <p>Final 1996 MLS Standings</p> <p>GP   W  WS  LS   L   GF  GA   Pts</p> <p>Eastern Conference</p> <p>Tampa Bay Mutiny           32  19   1   3   9   66  51   58</p> <p>DC United                  32  15   1   3  13   62  56   46</p> <p>NY/NJ MetroStars           32  12   3   2  15   45  47   39</p> <p>Columbus Crew              32  11   4   5  12   59  60   37</p> <p>New England Revolution     32   9   6   2  15   43  56   33</p> <p>Western Conference</p> <p>Los Angeles Galaxy         32  15   4   4   9   59  49   49</p> <p>Dallas Burn                32  12   5   3  12   50  48   41</p> <p>Kansas City Wiz            32  12   5   2  13   61  63   41</p> <p>San Jose Clash             32  12   3   6  11   50  50   39</p> <p>Colorado Rapids            32   9   2   4  17   44  59   29</p> <p>Quarterfinals:   DC United defeated MetroStars, 2-3 (SO), 1-0, 2-1</p> <p>Tampa Bay defeated Columbus, 2-0, 1-2, 4-1</p> <p>Kansas City defeated Dallas, 3-2, 1-2, 3-2 (SO)</p> <p>Los Angeles defeated San Jose, 0-1, 2-0, 2-0</p> <p>Semifinals:      DC United defeated Tampa Bay, 4-1, 2-1</p> <p>Los Angeles defeated Kansas City 2-1, 3-2 (SO)</p> <p>MLS CUP '96:     DC United defeated Los Angeles 3-2(OT)</p> <p>LEADING SCORERS</p> <p>NAME                                 GP   G  A  Pts</p> <p>Roy Lassiter, Tampa Bay Mutiny       30  27  4   58</p> <p>Eduardo Hurtado, Los Angeles Galaxy  26  21   7  49</p> <p>Preki, Kansas City Wiz               32  18  13  49</p> <p>Raul Diaz Arce, D.

Rochester was an immediate hit with the fans, drawing over 9,000 fans per game, nearly as good as some of the MLS teams. The league continued with seven teams, including the revitalized Vancouver 86ers who nearly folded, being saved at the last minute through new financing. Although small, the league boasted some powerful teams, despite the loss of many top players to Major League Soccer. The Montreal Impact dominated the A-League this season, with 55 points to easily win the regular season title.</p> <p>The league had followed MLS's example, establishing a 3-1-0 scoring system with one-on one shootout tiebreakers, ending much of the confusion in last year's standings. Colorado Foxes came in a strong second, holding up well while in competition with the MLS Rapids. Rochester came in 4th, but outdrew the rest of the league by a wide margin, leading to movement for the Rhinos to apply for MLS membership in the near future. Only the New York Fever and the hapless Atlanta Ruckus seemed hopeless on the field. In the playoffs, Rochester defeated Montreal 3-2, 0-3 and 2-1, while Seattle defeated Colorado 1-0, 0-2 and 3-0. The Championship game was a showdown between an established club and an upstart, as Seattle defeated Rochester 2-0 to claim the crown. But Rochester added to their triumphal debut by making it to the US Open Cup final, defeating several MLS opponents, before losing to the Open Cup champion D. C. United. The A-League drew 464,934 fans during the regular season, averaging 4,946 fans per game.</p> <p>After the season, the A-League added Toronto Lynx and the Hershey Wildcats, but with competition looming on the horizon in the form of the USISL's Select League applying for Division 2 status, it appeared this move was a risky one. Recognizing the futility of unnecessary competition and salary wars, A-League Commissioner Richard Groff and USISL Commissioner Francisco Marcos put aside their differences and agreed to merge. What actually happened was that the A-League folded, and six of the seven teams (all except New York) joined the Select League, which was renamed the A-League, and with a few other franchise shifts was re-established as a 24 team league with official USSF sanctioning as a Division 2 league. Better yet, with franchises in the three largest Canadian cities, it was recognized as the official Division 1 league for Canada.</p> <p>The A-League continued its sponsorship with Umbro (the major sponsor of the USISL), and continued the television contract with Prime, for a 20 game slate. Although the talent was somewhat diluted by the large increase in teams, the league was much more viable now, and provided a critical link in the establishment of a true multi-divisional structure for the USA.</p> <p>Final A-League Standings, 1996</p> <p>Rochester Raging Rhinos were added.

The league was also re-named the United Systems of Independent Soccer Leagues. Teams spanned the nation and were selected primarily on their financial and off the field performance. The aim was to gain FIFA sanctioning at the 2nd division level. In addition, the USISL established a working relationship with MLS, with each MLS club being assigned two Select League clubs as farm clubs, in effect making the USISL a ""minor League"" system.</p> <p>This first year, 31 players were called up to MLS, with 28 being loaned down. This was the next step in the USISL's vision of developing soccer from the ground up, and forestalling competition from the A-League. Although this originally could have sparked a destructive salary war, the A-league and USISL reached a merger agreement (see above) following the 1996 season. This finally brought all of the outdoor leagues together in a single cooperative system, establishing the first truly complete divisional soccer structure in the United States, in line with common practice through the rest of the world. Overall, 84 players from the USISL and A-League had been drafted by MLS teams when they initially stocked their teams.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Pro League and Premier league saw considerable reshuffling as the USISL clarified the performance standards for the different levels. Firm revenue and salary guidelines were established, and many weaker teams were moved to the Premier (amateur) league, with other financially troubled teams folding outright, and a score of new teams added, mostly to the Premier League.</p> <p>When the dust settled, the Premier league had 44 teams, the Pro League had 27 and the Select League had 20. The divisional structures were simplified, and the playoffs were revamped, although still retaining the ""select six"", ""sizzling six"", and ""premier six"" round robins. Meanwhile, the Women's W-League, coming off their successful debut season, added a number of teams, mostly in the east and Midwest. To mesh more closely with MLS, the USISL dropped most of their rules modifications and experiments, adopting the MLS and A-League 3-1-0 scoring system with shootout tiebreakers. Most importantly, these modifications were applied uniformly to all the USISL outdoor leagues, ending the confusion that had plagued the US scene for several years.</p> <p>The Select League had a successful debut season. With the strongest teams concentrated together in a single circuit, the competitive level improved greatly, leading to a stronger forum for player development, as well as providing some exciting games. The league did well in attendance, drawing 509,785 fans, averaging 1,782 per game. The Long Island Rough Riders won the North Atlantic Division in a close race with ever strong Richmond Kickers, but in the South Atlantic, the Carolina Dynamo cruised to an easy title. In the Central Division, Milwaukee and Minnesota built up a heated rivalry, fighting it out to the end with Milwaukee coming on top by a mere 3 points. The California Jaguars took the Pacific ahead of Sacramento.</p> <p>After two rounds of playoffs, Richmond, California, Charleston, Hampton Roads, Long Island, and Minnesota advanced to the ""Select Six. This time, the teams were divided into two groups. In Group A, Richmond defeated Charleston 6-1, and lost to California 1-0, while California defeated Charleston 3-1. In Group B, Minnesota defeated Hampton Roads 3-2, while losing 0-1 to Long Island, who defeated Hampton Roads 3-2. Another innovation: Four teams advanced out of the round robins to the semifinals, where California defeated Minnesota 4-2, and Richmond defeated Long Island 1-0. The Championship saw California draw Richmond 1-1, and then win in the shootout 3-2. There were 2,800 fans at Richmond Stadium, and California Goalkeeper Kevin Eueda was the star of the day with three critical saves, as he preserved the tie.</p> <p>Final 1996 USISL Select League Standings and Playoff Results</p> <p>Before the season, New York/New Jersey, South Carolina, and Sacramento</p> <p>were added.

With the loss of teams to the new Select league, other teams had an opportunity to rise to the top, chief among them Central Jersey, Charlotte eagles, Dallas/Ft Worth, and Everett, who won their respective divisions. The Pro League drew 246,424 fans per game, averaging 790 per game, reflecting the loss of the strongest clubs to the Select League. The Western Conference had an exciting three way tie between Everett, Valley and Yakima. A series of conference semifinals and finals reduced the playoff pool to six teams who, like in the Select League, split into two groups for the ""sizzling six"" tournament. In Group A, Charleston defeated Dallas/Ft. Worth 2-1, and lost in overtime to Chico 1-2. Chico then lost to Charleston 1-2. In Group B, Wilmington defeated North Jersey 3-0, and lost to Charlotte 0-1. Charlotte then defeated North Jersey 6-2.</p> <p>As with the Select league, the top four teams advanced to the semifinals, those being Charlotte, Wilmington, Charleston and Chico. In the semifinals, Charlotte defeated Chico 1-0 and Charleston defeated Wilmington 2-0. The Championship game was a nailbiter, being tied most of the way. Scoring started off of a Chris Dias goal in the 28th minute, but Charlotte tied it up with 70 seconds to go before halftime when Josh Farrar pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area and landed it in the net. Charleston scored again in the 52nd minute on an excellent corner kick conversion, as Stephen Winters headed the corner to Alvaro Betancur, who backheeled it past the goalie. Charleston pulled ahead in the 74th minute as Jeremy Sorzano kicked in a loose ball from Jon Payne. But Charleston's goalkeeper Pigford dug in,, and the Battery scored again to lead the game into a shootout where the Charleston Battery prevailed on scores by Olafere and Winters. As a result, Charleston advanced to the Select Six round robin tournament of the Select League. This award marked the first form of promotion in the history of American Soccer, and even if it was only for the one tournament, that was a start.</p> <p>Top Scorers:</p> <p>G   A  Pts</p> <p>Philbert Jones, Charlotte       18  20  46</p> <p>Patrick Olalere, Charleston     20   5  45</p> <p>Craig Beeson, Everett           17   2  36</p> <p>Jon Payne, Charlotte            14   8  36</p> <p>Carlos Rocha, Rhode Island      15   3  33</p> <p>Robert DeLuca, North Jersey     14   3  31</p> <p>Pat O'Kelly, Central Jersy      12   6  30</p> <p>Leading Goalkeepers: (min 720 minutes)</p> <p>Min  GA  GAA</p> <p>Chris Carmiento, Hawaii         930   8  0.77</p> <p>Roman Melin, S.

Being the bottom level of the USISL, and an amateur league, the Premier League was unique in that it included college players who were able to get full-year experience by playing Premier League soccer in the spring and summer, while returning to their colleges for the fall. This gave them an advantage in their endeavor to develop to the point where they could go pro, and not have to face the traditional handicaps suffered by college players due to lack of adequate playing experience. The league drew 206,794 fans, averaging 586 per game. Playoff victories included San Luis Obispo defeating Mid-Michigan 3-0, Jackson defeated Cocoa 1-0, San Luis Obispo defeated Jackson 2-1, San Francisco defeated Mid-Michigan 4-0 and Cocoa defeated Omaha 4-1. The two top teams advanced to the championship game where San Luis Obispo defeated San Francisco 1-0.</p> <p>Most Valuable Player:  Pasi Kinturi, Nashville Metros</p> <p>Top Scorer:  Pasi Kinturi, Nashville Metros (19 goals, 46 points)</p> <p>Goalkeeper of the Year (Eduardo Yoldi Memorial Award):  Mike LeBerge, Colorado</p> <p>Springs Stampede (1,388 min, 11 GA, 0.71 GAA)</p> <p>Coach of the Year: Dan Tobias, Central Coast Roadrunners</p> <p>Defender of the Year:  Dwayne Demmin, Jackson Chargers</p> <p>Rookie of the Year:  Eduardo Yoldi, San Francisco All-Blacks</p> <p>Organization of the Year:  Central Coast Roadrunners</p> <p>The W-League built on their first successful year by adding ten teams and strengthening their Midwest and west coast contingents. Several professional players returned from overseas stints to join the League and the USISL worked with the National Team to encourage some members to join as well. A working relationship would be established for the following season to formalize this plan.</p> <p>The league remained amateur, meaning college stars were also able to take part. The W-League drew 24,547 fans, averaging 203 per game, but these numbers would grow rapidly in subsequent seasons as several teams were launched than even outperformed their male counterparts. This growth reflected the tremendous growth in women's soccer in general that was to occur through the rest of the 1990's. The Denver Diamonds, Dallas Lightning and newly renamed Maryland Pride were the respective division winners, with Denver and Dallas both fighting intensive regular season races for the divisional honors.</p> <p>As in the Men's leagues, two rounds of playoffs yielded six winners who entered the final ""Swizzling Six"" tournament, featuring the Denver Diamonds, Columbus Ziggx, Maryland Pride, Chicago Cobras, Dallas Lightning and Rockford 'Dactyls. Only Maryland emerged with two wins, dispatching Chicago 1-0 and Rockford 4-0. Dallas also advanced based on tournament points earned in previous games (The loss to Columbus coming off of a shootout after a scoreless tie). Coincidentally, both victors had entered as the top two seeds in the tournament based on regular season records, but Dallas had gotten the #1 spot based on more goals scored.</p> <p>The most exciting game was Denver's 3-1 victory over Columbus. The Ziggx had gone ahead on a Jodi Stranges goal, but Denver roared back with three 2nd half goals by Kari Uppinghouse, Nicole Crepeau and Kelly Walbert. The next day, Laura Kerrigan landed a hat trick. The Championship game was held on August 11 in Love Park, IL. The Maryland Pride gained control of the game in the first half with a 36th minute goal by Emily Pickering. Betsy Anderson scored at the end of the 2nd half, and Cindy Harkes scored in the 2nd, as the defense held Dallas scoreless on the way to a 3-0 shutout for the crown.</p> <p>Leading Scorers:</p> <p>G  A  Pts</p> <p>Marci Miller, Chicago               12  1  25</p> <p>Kristen Kurzyneowski, Philadelphia  11  0  22</p> <p>Cheri Skipski, Chicago               8  5  21</p> <p>Mindy Bassett, Maryland              9  1  19</p> <p>Heather Maler, Rockford              7  4  18</p> <p>Kara Reynolds, Dallas                8  1  17</p> <p>Kelly Walbert, Denver                7  2  16</p> <p>Crystal Harper, Hampton Roads        8  0  16</p> <p>Lori Hokerson, Southern California   8  0  16</p> <p>Leading Goalkeepers: (Min. 450 minutes)</p> <p>Min  G   GAA</p> <p>Kim Clark, Dallas                460  3  0.59</p> <p>Kim Wyant, Long Island           610  4  0.59</p> <p>Merit Elzey, Chicago             591  5  0.76</p> <p>Vida Donahue, Rochester          460  4  0.78</p> <p>Karen Cook, San Francisco        565  5  0.80</p> <p>Kerry Dzchczkanierei, Maryland   540  5  0.83</p> <p>Most Valuable Player  Kristen Kurzyneowski, Philadelphia Frenzy</p> <p>Leading Goalie:  Kim Wyant, Long Island Lady Riders</p> <p>Coach of the Year:  Carolyn Rice, Maryland Pride</p> <p>Swizzlin' Six MVP:  Laura Kerrigan, Maryland Pride</p> <p>The indoor season continued to shrink, at least as a full-season activity, with only nine teams participating, supplemented by nine teams playing limited schedules. The Atlanta Magic again shone as they won the regular season Southeast title, along with the Dallas Lightning in the Central. There were no divisional races to speak of as these two really dominated. The ""Sizzlin' five"" playoffs were another round robin of five games which yielded two winners, the Baltimore Bays and Atlanta Magic. This time the Magic ran out, as Baltimore defeated Atlanta 10-6 for the indoor title.</p> <p>Scoring Leaders:   (as of January 12, 1996)</p> <p>Player                   G      A PTS</p> <p>Juha Miettnen, KNO      21      5 47</p> <p>Chris Hellenkamp, ATL   12     21 45</p> <p>Virgil Stevems, TUL     18(1)   8 44</p> <p>Shane Schwab, TUL       16     10 42</p> <p>Aaron Gordon, DAL       17      7 41</p> <p>Kyle Owen, MES          16      7 39</p> <p>Keiran Breslin, COC     15      7 37</p> <p>Richard Richmond, ATL   15      7 37</p> <p>Dennison Cabral, BAL    12      8 32</p> <p>Colin Rocke, DAL        11     10 32</p> <p>Goalkeeping Leaders: (as of January 12, 1996)</p> <p>Player                  Min GA GAA</p> <p>Matt Stewart, OKL       180 10 3.33</p> <p>Richard Northcutt, ATL  598 44 4.41</p> <p>Mathias Peltz, DFW       60  5 5.00</p> <p>Matt St. Jean, BAL      199 18 5.43</p> <p>Shawn Ray, DAL          536 51 5.71</p> <p>Peter Moore, ORL        356 35 5.73</p> <p>Sonny Dalesandro, TUL   308 35 6.82</p> <p>Brent Jameson, OKL      308 35 6.82</p> <p>Deacon Dorcas, BRA       90 11 7.33</p> <p>Chris Butler, TUL       355 44 7.44</p> <p>This was a year of stability and growing career legends for the NPSL. Tampa Bay joined the circuit with Philadelphia promised for next season. Dayton Dynamos, a long-standing franchise moved to Cincinnati. The NPSL averaged over 5,500 fans per game, and did not worry too much about competition from the impending Major League Soccer. As fortune had it, most of the major stars were bypassed by the MLS draft. A score of players were drafted, but an agreement with MLS allowed players to participate in both seasons, with those teams in playoffs having first dibs.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as one looks back over the 12 years of history, several players were establishing impressive long-term stats as perennial leaders: Hector Marinaro at forward and Victor Noguiera in goal in particular were two of the best in the history of the indoor game, and were still in the prime of their careers. They held all the significant records, and the end was nowhere in sight. The St. Louis Ambush set a regular season average attendance mark of 9,102 fans per game, echoing the St. Louis Steamer's attendance feats in the old MISL. The league attendance totaled over 1,500,000 for the 4th consecutive season.</p> <p>The Cleveland Crunch easily won the American Division, while Kansas City Attack won a close race with the Milwaukee Wave for the National Division as a new healthy rivalry continued to develop. In the divisional finals, the top four teams advanced to the second round easily with one notable exception. Second place Milwaukee was upset by the St. Louis Ambush and headed home early, with several players going off to their MLS debuts. In the semifinals, Cleveland beat Baltimore 15-11, 16-14 (OT), 14-23, 13-12. In a see-saw battle, Kansas City defeated St. Louis 18-16, 14-25, 4-1, 10-30, and 20-9. The Championship returned to Cleveland on the strength of leading goal-scorer Hector Marinaro as they roared back from a two game deficit to defeat Kansas City 18-28, 17-22, 24-12, 19-9, 20-16, and 16-12.</p> <p>Final NPSL League Standings, 1995-1996</p> <p>Before the season, Tampa Bay was added, and Dayton moved to Cincinnati.</p> <p>G   W   L    %   GB   GF   GA</p> <p>American Division</p> <p>Cleveland Crunch           40  31   9  .775  --  775  553</p> <p>Baltimore Spirit           40  25  15  .625   6  604  492</p> <p>Harrisburg Heat            40  24  16  .600   7  604  516</p> <p>Buffalo Blizzard           40  21  19  .525  10  562  586</p> <p>Cinci.

The league was finally starting to enjoy some stability in franchise lineups, and the product on the field was the best ever under the new two division format. Dallas's Tatu scored his 716th career goal on August 9, becoming the leading scorer in indoor history, passing legendary Steve Zungul. A week later he also become the all-time point leader. This left only the Assist record, which he broke on August 31. In a further sign of prosperity, the CISL signed a three year television agreement with Fox Sports at the end of the season.</p> <p>The CISL fared quite well during the launch of its summer competition, Major League Soccer. Only a scattering of players were lost to the MLS, none of them being major scorers or goalies. This would be an indication of the substantial differences in the outdoor and indoor games. Players well adjusted to the tight confines of the rink and those who can strategize and endure in the wide open spaces of the field truly are a different breed, and many of the best were simply in the arena that suits them best. One source of pride for the CISL was when they actually beat the NPSL for average regular season game attendance, averaging 5,936 per game, although due to the league's smaller size, total attendance was a more modest 914,121.</p> <p>The regular season saw an exciting race in the east as Monterrey and Houston fought their way through the entire season to finish as co-champs. In the west, the San Diego Sockers, who trace their history back to the halcyon days of the NASL, return to top form again as they win the West, just two games ahead of Anaheim who win a last-minute battle for 2nd place against Sacramento Knights. In the Quarterfinals, San Diego, Houston, Monterrey and Dallas advance in quick series. In the semifinals, Houston knocked off San Diego, ending their comeback hopes, 9-7, 4-8, 10-5, although the Sockers didn't give up easily, in what would turn out to be their last games ever. Monterrey defeated Dallas 10-4, and 5-3, setting up the 4th CISL Championship, where Monterrey defeated Houston 10-6 and 6-5, to become the first repeating champion in CISL history.</p> <p>Final CISL League Standings, 1996</p> <p>Before the season, Indianapolis was added.

This was a particularly good opportunity for the women, as the Olympics had just added women's soccer. The women hoped to make up for their disappointing finish in the 1995 World Championships, and had improved greatly in the ensuing months. The men also hoped for a much better finish to demonstrate their vast improvements since the last US Olympics when the National Team was little more than a sidelight in American Soccer. The hometown crowds would provide an advantage, even though the soccer games were not being held in Atlanta like the rest of the Olympic tournament. The USOC had gone all out to ensure that these games would be a major affair. To expose the competition to a broad audience, summer games were played in Miami, Washington, Birmingham and Athens, GA. The finals would be played in 84,000 seat Sanford Stadium in Athens, and the women pool games would be doubleheaders with the men's games to ensure maximum exposure. Although total attendance was not as high as for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles (1,421,627, average 44,426), they were still impressive, drawing more fans than for any other Olympic event, with 1,364,142 (average 40,122). This is more than the combined total for the Seoul 1988 games (728,712 average 22,772) and Barcelona 1992 (466,300 average 14,572) combined.</p> <p>The eligibility rules had changed for the 1996 games. The competition was again limited to the U-23 teams, but this time, each team was allowed to add three over-23 players to the roster. This was important for the US as their U-23 team was not of the same caliber as the full national team. The Olympic team was coached by Virginia and D. C. United coach Bruce Arena. Despite a challenging schedule of friendlies, the US began the pool play with a disappointing 3-1 loss to Argentina. They played well, but Argentina, a powerhouse, included several division 1 players on their roster. The US had scored in the first minute and dominated for awhile, but Argentina gradually took over and eventually pulled away for the victory. The good news was the crowd of 83,810 at Legion Field in Birmingham, the largest crowd ever to see a soccer game in Alabama.</p> <p>Two days later, the US bounced back with a good 2-0 win over Tunisia off of goals by Jovan Kirovski and Brian Maisonneuve. By then, the US was tied for third with Argentina and Portugal with 3 points. But because of the other teams' performances, the US was in a tight position. Unless the US beat Portugal and Argentina was upset by Tunisia, they were out of luck. In the USA-Portugal game, the US fell behind early, but tied it in the 75th after a Maisonneuve goal, but could do no more, and ended with a draw, making Tunisia's surprising draw with Argentina an academic matter. Once again, the US was out.</p> <p>The tournament was only picking up steam by now. Games continued apace in Birmingham, Washington, Miami and Orlando, with a high level of excitement and competition reminiscent of the recently completed European championships. The eight teams to emerge from pool play were Argentina, Portugal, France, Brazil, Mexico, Ghana and Spain. Brazil, which featured Bebeto and Ronaldo, was particularly eager to win their first Olympic championship, defeating Ghana convincingly after falling behind 2-1. Argentina whomped Spain 4-0, while Portugal got past France 2-1 and Nigeria downed Mexico 2-0.</p> <p>The semifinal against Nigeria was a nail biter for Brazil, as Nigeria fought back from a 3-1 deficit to tie the game in the 90th minute, sending the match to overtime. In a climactic showdown, Nigeria's Nwankwu Kanu scored the game-winner in the 93rd minute, dashing Brazil's hopes once again. This was particularly painful for the blue and yellow, because for once, they were really taking the Olympics seriously and had pinned their hopes on a gold medal. Meanwhile Argentina easily beat Portugal 2-0, setting up a cross-continent final for Sanford Stadium. This game, played before a massive crowd of 86,117, was the biggest day ever for African Soccer. And the game lived up to the hype. Nigeria fell behind twice before Daniel Amokachi tied the game in the 75th minute, and Emmanuel Amunike scored the game winner with less than 1 minute left in the match. Nigeria took the gold, Argentina took the silver and Brazil took the bronze. Despite the US's performance, the competition itself was one of the best Olympic tournaments ever.</p> <p>Unlike the men's competition, the women fielded their full teams. Originally, the IOC had declined to add women's soccer, but bowed to a relentless international media campaign. The field was smaller, only 8 teams, and pool play was paired with men's games to ensure exposure. By the time of the knockout competition, the point had been made, and the remaining women's games drew perfectly well by themselves; by the time the games were over, the top thirteen crowds in US history for women's games had just been set, including an amazing 76,489 for the final. As much as the competition itself, this clearly showed that Women's soccer had arrived, and portended great things for the upcoming 1999 Women's World Cup, also to be held in the United States.</p> <p>The US team played up to the hopes and hype, completing a magnificent performance that brought them the gold medal, and also reflecting the improved quality of the players, both US and foreign. Women's soccer was developing by leaps and bounds by now. The competition began with a solid 3-0 victory by US over Denmark, one of the stronger European teams. Tisha Venturini broke a scoreless tie in the 37th minute by half-volleying a throw-in from Brandi Chastain, which the goalkeeper pushed right into the net. Mia Hamm and Tiffeny Milbrett scored the other two. Two days later, The US beat powerhouse Sweden 2-1 off a Venturini goal in the 15th minute, and a second half goal by Shannon MacMillan. By now, the US and China were already qualified for the later rounds. This rendered the final Pool game between the US and China meaningless except to determine next round opponents. Despite that, 43,525 filled the Orange Bowl for the contest which ended in a scoreless tie.</p> <p>The semifinals saw China pitted against Brazil while the US lined up to face their perennial rival Norway and this was another tense game, as the US fell behind Norway in the first half, and equalized on a Michelle Akers penalty shot in the 76th. Norway lost a player to a red card, and Shannon MacMillan scored the winner in overtime, giving the US some much desired revenge against their world-leading rival. China also scored a come from behind victory over Brazil. China was a familiar opponent for the Americans, having played them in the US Cup final just two months before. This game was close to the wire, with the US winning 2-1 on goals by MacMillan and Fawcett. Thus was completed the most significant event yet for women's soccer, and a great triumph for the American team.</p> <p>Two major changes were made for this competition: The games were moved to January from the summer, and Brazil was invite to the tournament, in a reciprocal agreement with COMNEBOL who had invited two CONCACAF teams to the Copa America. Brazil, with strength to spare sent their Olympic team to gain more experience, but still won the cup anyway. The competition was held in southern California, and the US was eager to bring back the North American championship, but it was not to be this time. The US performance was still impressive nonetheless, as they beat Trinidad 3-2 off of two Eric Wynalda goals, and El Salvador 2-0.</p> <p>In the semifinals, the US faced Brazil in a rematch of their Copa American matchup, and the score was the same, with the US losing 0-1. The US had control of the field most of the time, but a Salvio shot deflected off of Marcelo Balboa's leg for the score. The US bounced back to defeat Guatemala 3-0 in the 3rd place game with goals by Wynalda, Jeff Agoos, and Jovan Kirovski. The final, played before 88,155 at the Los Angeles Coliseum was an exciting game as Mexico defeated the young Brazilians 3-2 to keep the Cup. Overall, the US performance was a good omen, considering the US's strong performances against future World Cup qualifying opponents.</p> <p>The Men's National Team, although eclipsed by the Olympic competition, still had a number of significant victories and tournaments in 1996. One of the major events was the 1996 Gold Cup Tournament (see above).</p> <p>The US's next major tournament was the US Cup. This time it was a cross-country affair with games in Washington, Foxboro and Los Angeles. After a warm-up exhibition victory over Scotland in late May, the US opened with a close victory over Ireland in Foxboro with goals by Tab Ramos and Claudio Reyna. That was followed by another surprising loss to Bolivia, 0-1, with the sole goal scored in the 2nd minute of an otherwise scoreless game. In the final game, Mexico drew with the United States 1-1. The US had scored in the 34th minute from Wynalda, and looked to have the game and the Cup, but Mexico tied in the 89th minute, giving them the game, as well as the cup (based on goal differential). In comparison to last year, this was a disappointing effort for the US, especially with World Cup qualifying about to start in five months.</p> <p>The US trained intensively over the summer, pausing for friendlies with El Salvador (3-1 win) and Peru (a flat 1-4 trouncing) before the start of Qualifying. Because this was the first round, the competition included a number of weak nations, so the US had a fairly easy time of it, shutting out Guatemala, and Trinidad & Tobago (twice) before losing to a much stronger Costa Rica 2-1. They beat Costa Rica in the visit to San Jose, Costa Rica, before drawing to Guatemala 2-2. Wynalda scored two goals, and newcomers McBride, Hedjuk and Preki all scored goals, providing good performances for new MLS stars. The performance left something to be desired but was enough to get the US through the first round and four months to practice before the Hexagonal where the victories really counted.</p> <p>The highlight of the Women's year was the triumph at the inaugural Olympic event, but the team was busy with a full schedule as well. Continuing their January tournament tradition, the US entered the Brazil Soccer Cup competition, and swept the prizes, with four straight wins. The first was an 8-1 trouncing of the weak Russian side, with double scores by Cindy Parlow and Foudy among the treats. A closer 3-2 victory against host Brazil gave Mia Hamm her first goal of the year, and warmed the team up for a 6-0 shutout punishment of Ukraine courtesy of a hat trick by Carin Gabarra. The championship was a rematch with Brazil, and was a grueling draw all the way, but the US prevailed on penalty kicks.</p> <p>The Americans then began their intense practice schedule to prepare for the Olympics, starting off with a pair against the defending world champion squad Norway. A 3-2 win was followed by a 1-2 loss, to put the US on notice that Olympic Gold was not a sure bet by any means. Double headers with powerhouses Germany and Sweden and France saw the US six wins richer, to put them in a good mood for USA Cup '96. The USA Cup was another sweep for the US, as they defeated Canada 6-0, Japan 4-0 and China 1-0. ten players scored the 11 goals for this tournament. The US was DEEP. A final pair of matching 2-1 victories over Australia sent the US to Georgia and the Olympics in grand style (see Olympics above). The US triumph gave the team a well deserved vacation to enjoy, relish and experience. They did not play again until the following February.</p> <p>The 1996 Open Cup was the first to include Professional Division 1 clubs since the early 1930s as MLS entered eight of its ten teams in the tournament. They were arrayed against four teams from the A-league and the USISL. D. C. United, Tampa Bay Mutiny, Dallas Burn and Kansas City Wiz received byes to the quarterfinals. The rest of the MLS clubs advanced easily. In the quarterfinals, D. C. United defeated Carolina Dynamo (USISL) 2-0, Dallas defeated the Seattle Sounders (A-League) 3-2, the Rochester Rhinos (A-League) upset Tampa Bay Mutiny 4-3 and the Colorado Rapids (who had replaced the Colorado Foxes at the last minute) defeated Kansas City 3-2.</p> <p>In the semifinals, D. C. United beat the Dallas Burn 2-0, and Rochester Rhinos defeated Colorado 3-0, bringing a surprise, with the A-League getting their first team into the Open Cup finals. The title match, played at RFK Stadium in washington was a rout for D. C. united, who delighted the home crowd of 7,234 with a 3-0 shutout of Rochester, on their way to earning the ""double"", which would come when they won MLS Cup '96.</p> <p>International Clubs vs. Major League Soccer: Results:  5 wins, 2 draws, 6 losses; May 22 through November 10, 1996</p> <p>(Home teams listed first)</p> <p>5/22/96  New England Revolution 0, Fiorentina (Italy) 2</p> <p>5/24/96  NY/NJ Metrostars 0, Fiorentina (Italy) 4</p> <p>5/26/96  San Jose Clash 3, Bayer Leverkusen (Germany) 4</p> <p>5/26/96  Tampa Bay Mutiny 1, Feynoord (Holland) 1</p> <p>6/5/96   Metrostars 1, Sporting Lisbon (Portugal) 1</p> <p>6/12/96  San Jose Clash 2, UNAM Pumas (Mexico) 1</p> <p>7/11/96  Los Angeles Galaxy 1, El Salvador National Team 1</p> <p>8/14/96  Los Angeles Galaxy 1, Nexaca (Mexico) 2</p> <p>9/10/96  D.

So what else is new? But men's growth tapered as colleges struggled to achieve Title IX compliance, yet still established a record high for varsity teams, rising from 676 to 681. This disappointing news was offset by the fact that this struggle made possible major improvements for varsity women's program throughout the nation. Soccer most of all benefited, with women's programs expanding from 619 to 690, to surpass the men in scope for the first time. Pretty impressive when one considers there were only 77 women's programs in 1981, and only 17 three years before!</p> <p>In the 1996 Men's Division 1 Tournament, third round action saw Creighton defeat Fresno State 2-0, St. John's defeat William & Mary 2-1 in overtime, UNC Charlotte defeated Hartford 3-0, and Florida International defeated Indiana 1-0. In the semifinals, St. John's defeated Creighton 2-1 and Florida International defeated UNC Charlotte 4-0. The Championship returned to Richmond, VA where on December 15, St. John's won the crown by defeating Florida International 4-1</p> <p>The NCAA, recognizing the growth of women's soccer, both in quantity and quality, expanded the Division 1 Women's tournament from 24 to 32 teams. Likewise, the Division II tournament was expanded from 8 to 12, and the Division III tournament from 20 to 24. In the Women's Division 1 tournament, third round action saw North Carolina (who else?) shut out (what else?) Florida State 9-0 (were you expecting anything less?). Santa Clara defeated Connecticut 1-0, Portland defeated Nebraska 1-0 and Notre Dame defeated Maryland 3-2. In the Semifinals, North Carolina defeated Santa Clara 2-1 and Notre Dame defeated Portland 3-2. The championship moved to Santa Clara, California, but the result was very familiar: On December 8, North Carolina reclaimed the title, shutting out Notre Dame 1-0 in double overtime. UNC had by now become one of the all-time dynasties in American Sports, and in World sports for that matter.

Their relationship was visibly strained amidst Deripaska's financial struggles in 2009, but in a widely broadcast incident on Russian television, Putin visited a stalled cement factory owned by Deripaska and berated its management.","He forced Deripaska to sign a contract promising to pay nearly $1 million in unpaid wages.","<p>Oleg Deripaska, the Russian billionaire who is said to be Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's favourite industrialist, has gone unshaven for at least three days. He is in grey training pants, a white T-shirt and a dark blue fleece. His nine-year-old son Peter and the family's Labrador retriever, Leo, scurry about. It is 10:30 at night and Mr. Deripaska is relaxed, that is, as relaxed as anyone with 240,000 employees, a empire that nearly collapsed two years ago and a frisky dog trying to drag the table cloth (and all the plates with it) onto the floor can be.</p> <p>We are in the Deripaska family chalet about 20 kilometres outside of Moscow. A small ski hill next to the chalet is floodlit, exposing a few of the security guards who are an eternal presence in his life. Mr. Deripaska flops onto one of the cushy, low-slung chairs, orders tea from the kitchen staff and invites me to call him Oleg.</p> <p>The bookshelves are laden with classic Russian novels and books on modern Japanese design - Mr. Deripaska loves Tokyo. Peter, who speaks English with a British accent (he and his sister share a British nanny) is showing us how Leo can dance on his hind legs. His father laughs. ""Very intelligent dogs, Labradors,"" he says.</p> <p>The modern chalet is big but not ostentatious. ""I am not in Aspen, I live in Moscow,"" he says in an English that has improved markedly since I last interviewed him in his Moscow office in early 2008. Less than a year later, he was fighting for survival as the financial crisis shredded the value of his holdings.</p> <p>Exactly how Mr. Deripaska managed to save Rusal - the aluminum company that was the main source of his wealth - and other investments, is still a matter of debate. Certainly he won a standoff with foreign creditors, but some think he would be dead and buried without a little help from his Kremlin friends, who evidently had no desire to see his investments seized by non-Russians. When his fortunes turned desperate in the bleakest months of the crisis, Mr. Deripaska's long-standing record of plowing his fortunes back into Russia, no doubt helped his cause; some of his fellow oligarchs chose instead to acquire overseas trophy assets like American and British sports teams.</p> <p>Because he knows I am Canadian, he tells me how Peter has developed a passion for Canadian maple syrup. I wonder where he gets the stuff and before I can ask, he explains that his son was given a load of syrup by Barrick Gold chairman Peter Munk. The booty formed part of the cargo of Mr. Munk's yacht and was transferred to the Deripaskas' in Montenegro, where the two billionaires are developing a superyacht marina. As it turns out, maple syrup is not the only bit of Canadiana on Mr. Deripaska's mind. Two others are the Vancouver Olympics and Hydro-Quebec.</p> <p>Mr. Deripaska visited Vancouver (and attended the Russia-Canada hockey playoff) to get ideas for his developments at Sochi, the southern Russian town that will host the 2014 winter Olympics. Hydro-Quebec might hold the key to his global hydroelectric ambitions. He told me he leaves Sunday for Montreal to discuss a possible partnership. ""They have knowledge and expertise,"" he says. ""We're looking for a partner to build new hydro plants.""</p> <p>The dining table is covered with cakes and fresh fruit that are rare treats in frozen Russia: Pomegranates, strawberries, blueberries, grapes, oranges and small, sweet apples that were grown on Mr. Deripaska's farm. I wolf down a pork chop and fried potatoes and sip on Scotch. He sticks with tea, ignores the fruit and half-heartedly tackles a piece of cake.</p> <p>Mr. Deripaska is 43, tall, slim and in good shape, thanks, apparently, to a careful diet and sporadic, though vigorous, bouts of cross-country skiing. With his stubble beard and close-cropped hair, he looks more like one of his security guards than the owner of Russia's most diversified industrial group, Basic Element, whose holdings range from uranium mines to Gaz, the car and truck maker that recently struck a deal with General Motors to produce small Chevrolets in Russia. There are more than 100 other companies in the empire, almost all of them private, in a bewildering array of industries. They include hotels, airports, defence and banks. Mr. Deripaska has a business that makes log cabins and another that publishes the Russian edition of Hello! magazine. Last year, the group's total revenues (unaudited) were $24.2-billion (U. S.).</p> <p>In spite of his wealth - Forbes magazine last put it at about $11-billion, down from a pre-crisis peak of $28-billion - Mr. Deripaska is not conspicuously flashy like many of the oligarchs. Roman Abramovich collects superyachts like so many bathtub toys, owns Britain's Chelsea football club and just forked out PS50-million ($79-million) for Spanish striker Fernando Torres. Suleiman Kerimov has a penchant for Ferraris, one of which he crashed in 2006, nearly burning him alive. Mikhail Prokhorov, the gold baron who loves to play basketball, owns the New Jersey Nets.</p> <p>That is not to say that Mr. Deripaska deprives himself. His 73-metre, six-deck yacht, the Queen K, is a regular visitor to the Mediterranean's most glamorous resorts. He shuns hotels wherever he can. Instead, he buys properties in the places he frequents: Tokyo, London, Montenegro, among others. Mr. Deripaska is shy and strives to avoid publicity, to the point he doesn't publicize his numerous charities, which have doled out $250-million (U. S.) over the last decade, largely to education projects.</p> <p>He is lucky he can play his own version of global Monopoly, for he came close to losing it all in the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>Mr. Deripaska was born in Krasnodar, in Cossack country's tea-growing region in the far south of Russia. He was drafted into the Soviet army, became an accomplished physics and math student and went on to study nuclear physics at Moscow State University. Graduating just as the old Soviet Union was giving away to the new, raw capitalist Russia, he like many of his contemporaries went into business instead of state research.</p> <p>He became a metals broker and emerged as the big winner of the so-called aluminum wars of the 1990s. The details are murky. What is known is that there were nasty bouts of violence. Mr. Deripaska often slept in his Siberian smelters so he could monitor their production during those turbulent years. Today Rusal is the biggest single source of his wealth. The company, floated on the Hong Kong exchange last year, is 47.4-per-cent owned by Mr. Deripaska, has a market value of about $25-billion and owns 25 per cent of Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel maker.</p> <p>In 2007 he was on top of the world, only to learn that leverage cuts both ways. The crisis crippled his real estate, manufacturing and auto businesses. Gaz alone blew out 50,000 workers (though has since rehired 15,000). A margin call deprived him of his $1.5-billion stake in Canadian auto parts company Magna International and he had to unload his stake in Strabag, the Austrian construction giant that is building infrastructure for the Sochi Olympics (he has since bought back into Strabag).</p> <p>When aluminum prices collapsed in the autumn of 2008, Rusal breached its covenants and seemed certain to become a ward of the international cadre of banks that had stuffed Rusal with $7.4-billion in loans.</p> <p>Mr. Deripaska used a combination of tough negotiations and clever gamesmanship to keep control of Rusal. He bet correctly that the banks would have no interest in owning and managing a massively complicated company, whose supply chain extends from alumina operations in Jamaica to Siberian hydropower plants. ""The deal was very simple,"" he says. ""We never tried to screw the banks. I said 'You keep the debt and I will manage the company and deliver for you.'""</p> <p>Another interpretation is that he owes Rusal's salvation to his impeccable government connections (he is married to the daughter of the chief-of-staff to former president Boris Yeltsin). Kremlin-controlled VEB bank gave Rusal a $4.5-billion bailout loan at the height of the financial crisis, allowing the company to restructure its foreign debt. The Kremlin would not have liked the alternative. The foreign banks might have seized Rusal, only to sell it to a rival such as Aloca or Rio Tinto. Big resources like aluminum are considered national strategic assets in Russia.</p> <p>The crisis appeared to damage Mr. Deripaska's relationship with Mr. Putin, however. In a televised broadcast in mid-2009 in a hard-hit Russian industrial town called Pikalyovo, Mr. Putin compared industrial barons who left workers' wages unpaid to cockroaches. He then forced Mr. Deripaska to sign a document safeguarding the future of a local factory, snapping ""And give me back my pen,"" the moment the crestfallen oligarch did so.</p> <p>The event played well in recession-racked Russia, but may have been staged political theatre. There no longer appears to be any friction between the two men. ""I believe Russia recognizes Oleg's major role in building a renewed economic base in a broad range of domestic businesses and rejuvenating ailing companies and infrastructure,"" says Tye Burt, the Kinross Gold chief executive officer in Toronto who knows Mr. Deripaska.</p> <p>After a tumultuous two years, Basic Element seems more or less stable in its somewhat diminished form. After a disastrous start on the stock market, Rusal shares are up about 50 per cent in the last six months. Norilsk is worth about $50-billion, putting the value of Rusal's stake at more than $12-billion. Gaz, whose production lines came to a virtual halt during the crisis, is pumping out cars again. ""Gaz is producing five times more vehicles than we used to produce during the Soviet Union [era]"" Mr. Deripaska says..</p> <p>The one looming threat, other than double-dip recession, is a nasty legal dispute with Michael Cherney, also known as Mikhail Chernoy, the Uzbekistan-born Israeli businessman and veteran of the aluminum wars who claims Mr. Deripaska cheated him out of a 20-per-cent stake in Rusal.</p> <p>Mr. Deripaska denies he owes Mr. Cherney anything. He claims he was forced to work with Mr. Cherney and that Mr. Cherney extorted money from him. In 2008, a British judge ruled that Mr. Cherney's claims could be heard in British court. The case is to begin in April, 2012. In the meantime, Interpol is seeking the arrest of Mr. Cherney for alleged money laundering in Spain.</p> <p>Mr. Deripaska is back in expansion mode and the one area that seems to excite him most, other than preparing Basic Element's Sochi airport and the Olympic village for the 2014 games, is hydroelectric power. EuroSibEnergo, Russia's biggest privately-owned hydro company, which is headed to the Hong Kong stock market next month, is emerging as Basic Element's potential growth champion. ""I believe that this company will double its capacity in next 20 to 25 years,"" he says.</p> <p>He believes that only hydro and nuclear power can save the planet from a carbon-dioxide fuelled inferno. ""Hydro causes a lot less environmental damage that coal,"" he says. ""Look at China; 3.2 billion tonnes of coal burned a year. Massive emissions into the atmosphere, massive ash on the ground.""</p> <p>But what about solar and wind power, and biofuels? Wind and solar are power, he says, will never been more than niche power sources while turning food like corn into fuel like ethanol is ""definitely a mistake"" because it puts upward pressure on food prices.</p> <p>Which leaves nuclear and hydro power. The problem with nuclear is the exceedingly long time, sometimes decades, between concept and production. Building hydro plants takes fewer years and, if properly constructed and maintained, can last for centuries.</p> <p>Enter Hydro-Quebec. Basic Element and Hydro-Quebec have been holding exploratory talks for several months about forming a technology and construction partnership to develop international power projects, possibly in Latin America. Mr. Deripaska is meeting Hydro-Quebec's top executives in Montreal Monday to see if a formal partnership can be launched.</p> <p>China is his other obsession. Mr. Deripaska doesn't buy the argument that China might be a bubble economy. ""They have real demand for everything, for cars, for apartments and kitchen appliances,"" he says. ""I just can't see anything that can stop them from growth. They just need it. It's not like the real estate market in Tokyo. That was artificial.""</p> <p>Russia in general and Basic Element in particular are poised to feed the Chinese tiger with everything from aluminum and hydro-power grids to uranium and rail cars. The potential is vast, he says, and will shift Basic Element's focus to the east, overhauling Russia's economy in the same way that Australia is thriving from its role as China's offshore storehouse of resources wealth. ""China's reflection in Australian GDP is 20 per cent,"" he says. ""In Russia, it's still less than 2 per cent.""</p> <p>Rusal, he says, is in a particularly good position to supply China because soaring Chinese energy costs will push down domestic aluminum production (making aluminum requires vast amounts of electricity). Imports will fill the gap. ""Over time, I am very optimistic that China will import aluminum and steel,"" he says. ""This will create opportunity for Rusal. Rusal will build another 1.5 million tonnes of capacity and become a six-million-tonne a year company.""</p> <p>Late in the evening, when the lights on the ski hill have been turned off and only the faint outline of trees against the snow is visible, I try to steer the conversation away from business and markets and statistics.</p> <p>Iask what motivates him and I get elliptical responses. As far as I can make out, he considers himself a Russian patriot who wants to combine the best of the old Soviet Union - superb science and engineering training, infrastructure development, pride of country - with modern capitalism to drag Russia into a new industrial age.</p> <p>""We are not investors,"" he says. ""We run businesses. I am living here, of course and I care. I know we have a unique opportunity for my [country]to be developed.""</p> <p>The implication is that he doesn't want to be like the oligarchs who invest in portfolios of companies, as if they were buying mutual funds, or taking their fortunes overseas to load up on trophy assets. He will even criticize the men who made huge profits from the ""loans-for-shares"" scheme in the 1990s, when the cash-strapped government traded equity in state-owned enterprises, from telecommunications to energy, for loans. A small group of Russians got exceedingly rich by taking control of valuable - though epically mismanaged - companies on the cheap (Mr. Deripaska was not involved in the loans-for-shares).</p> <p>The problem is that some of the industrialists, he says, ""did not fulfill their promises"" to reinvest back into Russia. Mr. Deripaska, the stay-at-home industrialist (minus the occasional yacht tour) considers Russia an obligatory market, as well as one that can earn him billions as he fixes up the decrepit economy.</p> <p>At one in the morning, Mr. Deripaska has work to do and escorts me to the door. He says goodbye. I expect him to reach for his BlackBerry or phone. Instead Leo comes thundering into the foyer and I watch through the window as the unshaven billionaire laughs as he plays with his pet.</p> <p>Editor's note: An earlier version of this story that appeared online and in Saturday's newspaper incorrectly stated that Britain's Chelsea football club paid PS50-billion ($79-billion) for Spanish striker Fernando Torres.

Like us on Facebook.</p> <p>Your first month is less than a dollar.</p> <p>One of the fastest-rising young artists connected to Dallas isn't a native of the city and doesn't live here anymore. Yet her presence is palpable.</p> <p>Mention her name to anyone in the arts community -- heck, mention it to anyone you meet, because she seems to know them all -- and chances are good you will be met with an outpouring of admiration and respect. Despite the fact that she left Dallas years ago, she is still considered one of our own. Morehshin Allahyari, born and raised in Tehran, Iran, immigrated to the United States in 2007. After receiving a master of arts degree in digital media studies from the University of Denver, she relocated to Denton, where she received a master of fine arts degree in new media studies from the University of North Texas in 2012.Allahyari went on to teach at UNT and in the Art and Technology program at the University of Texas at Dallas, while becoming a fixture in the burgeoning Dallas DIY art scene. She began cultivating a national and international reputation for her new media arts activism.In 2014, she relocated to San Francisco; she is currently in the midst of a yearlong residency at the nonprofit arts and technology studio Eyebeam in New York City.In December, Foreign Policy magazine named Allahyari one of the 100 Leading Global Thinkers of 2016. The artist was included on a list with some of the biggest names in politics (Hillary Clinton, for example), as well as science, technology and the arts. Allahyari was recognized for ""saving heritage on a Zip drive"" through her acclaimed project ""Material Speculation: ISIS,"" in which she used 3D printing to reconstruct Iraqi and Syrian cultural artifacts destroyed by ISIS.</p> <p>Artist Morehshin Allahyari used 3D printing to reconstruct Iraqi and Syrian cultural artifacts destroyed by ISIS in her acclaimed project ""Material Speculation: ISIS.""</p> <p>Marten, from artist Morehshin Allahyari's  Material Speculation project, featured in the Additivist Cookbook.

In addition to her busy solo practice, Allahyari is one-half of a collaborative with London-based artist, writer and academic Daniel Rourke called #Additivism. The name is a combination of ""additive"" and ""activism."" #Additivism is an ongoing project dedicated to the use of 3D printing as a radical tool against the growing science fiction-esque problems of contemporary life.</p> <p>In 2015, the pair released their hypnotic Additivist Manifesto, a black-and-white animated video of an oily, post-apocalyptic seascape riddled with ""kipple,"" a term coined by science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick to describe a type of self-replicating refuse that will eventually consume the earth. While the video slowly pans across the scene, a disembodied, robotic voice issues a call for humankind to embrace the need for a post-human world, one in which plastic will mesh with biological organisms to form new mechanisms of evolution and survival.The voice declares: ""Life exists only in action. There is no innovation that has not an aggressive character. We implore you -- radicals, revolutionaries, activists, Additivists -- to distill your distemper into texts, templates, blueprints, glitches, forms, algorithms and components. Creation must be a violent assault on the forces of matter, to extrude its shape and extract its raw potential ... For only Additivism can accelerate us to an aftermath whence all matter has mutated into the clarity of plastic. ""Less than two years after issuing this call, Allahyari and Rourke have released the The 3D Additivist Cookbook, a curated compendium of speculative designs that utilize 3D printing in strange and innovative ways.</p> <p>The book is available for free on the project website as a downloadable 3D PDF that can also be printed and placed in a binder, an homage to the practice of distributing zines and pamphlets by hand.</p> <p>The projects are classified according to hashtagged terms such as #play, #break and #collide, which allow them to be easily integrated and disseminated online. Imagine scrolling through your Instagram feed looking for a new recipe and instead stumbling across instructions for ""meshbombing"" or ""biointelligent membranes. ""Like Dick's kipple, the primary goal of #Additivism is to create a self-perpetuating movement. The book's introduction states, ""The 3D Additivist Cookbook is an idea, a community, a movement, an archive, and a collective effort to inspire and challenge narratives for governing, acting, networking, and creating together. #Additivism proposes that multiple, infinitely colorful and profoundly different worlds can and should exist simultaneously.""</p> <p>Recently, the collaborators were in Berlin presenting #Additivism at the annual transmediale festival. Their trip coincided with President Donald Trump's travel ban, which thrust the visa status of Iranian passport-carrying Allahyari into question for a brief but terrifying period. She made it back to New York to continue her project ""She Who Sees the Unknown,"" a techno-feminist reworking of the mythologies of Middle Eastern dark goddesses. Her Cookbook co-author, Rourke, is back in London, where he is completing his Ph.

In August 2018, a UBS Investment Bank trainee accused one of Orcel's managing directors of drugging and sexually assaulting her at a social gathering in September. Orcel personally invited her to his London office to clarify that the director had been suspended and subsequently resigned. Orcel appeared on Bloomberg Markets later that day explaining a revamped infrastructure and process of handling sexual misconduct at the company, noting it must be ""completely eradicated"". All throughout the late 2010s, it was speculated that Orcel was to either succeed Ermotti as the chief executive of UBS, or go on to lead either MPS, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, or UniCredit.

Kumaran, born on 17 June 1966 in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, earned his graduate degree in chemical engineering (BTech) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM) in 1987 and moved to the US for his higher studies and secured a PhD in 1991 from Cornell University.","His post-doctoral studies were at the University of California, Santa Barbara during 1991–93 and on his return to India, he joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as an assistant professor where he holds the position of a senior professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering and heads V. Kumaran's Research Group.","<p>The Infosys Prize 2016 in Engineering and Computer Science is awarded to Prof V. Kumaran, for his seminal work in complex fluids and complex flows and especially in transition and turbulence in soft-walled tubes and channels. His work is of high practical utility in cardio-vascular and pulmonary health. His work characterized by high quality applied mathematics and theoretical physics combined with innovative experiments and simulation has been translated into innovative technologies for lab-on-a-chip devices for point-of-care diagnostics.</p> <p>Prof. V. Kumaran is a senior professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Prof. Kumaran has been carrying out path-breaking research on many select topics in the areas of fluid mechanics and statistical mechanics.</p> <p>Kumaran received his B. Tech. in 1987 from IIT Madras and Ph. D. from Cornell University in 1992. He is a fellow of the Indian Academy of Science (1998), Indian National Science Academy (2001), and the Indian National Academy of Engineering (2006). More recently, Prof. Kumaran has been elected to the fellowship of the American Physical Society (2015).</p> <p>He has won several prestigious awards including the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize (2000), Swarnajayanthi Fellowship (2002), J. C. Bose Fellowship (2007), the Rustom Choksi Award (2012) for Excellence in Engineering Research by IISc, TWAS Prize (2014), and the APS-IUSSTF Chair Professorship (2014).</p> <p>Understanding the microfluidic devices has assumed significance in recent times due to their applications in cardio-vascular and pulmonary health, just to name a few. Prof V. Kumaran pioneered research in this area through his work on transition and turbulence in the flow through soft-walled tubes and channels.</p> <p>Using innovative combination of high quality theory and experiments and simulations, he has been able to experimentally demonstrate the onset of instability in flexible tubes at a Reynolds number as low as 500, something which has eluded experimentalists for over a decade since the first prediction by Kumaran. He has experimentally shown that using this instability, mixing efficiency  can be increased by many orders of magnitude in microfluidic devices in lab-on-a-chip applications, thus making it feasible to conduct complex reaction networks in reasonable time. This has the potential to alter the current paradigms used in the design of microfluidic devices.</p> <p>Apart from the scientific advance, the societal impact of his work is also being recognized. MicroXLabs, a start-up company working in Prof. Kumaran's lab has been awarded the first prize in the Tata Social Enterprise Challenge, a contest for social impact ideas that enrich the quality of life across rural India.</p> <p>Kumaran's work in formulating theories for flowing granular materials is very novel. He was the first to show that the grains in the flow can be modeled using a velocity distribution in a manner similar to gas molecules in the kinetic theory of gases. He has developed a statistical mechanics framework to provide quantitative predictions for the flow down an inclined plane, which is often encountered in geophysical phenomena (avalanches, landslides) and industrial applications (chutes, solids transport). Kumaran was the first to predict a novel 'transition' similar to the laminar-turbulent transition, in dense granular flows. This is an important advance in the elusive search for constitutive relations for flowing granular materials.</p> <p>Prof. Kumaran's work on the thermodynamics and dynamics of complex fluids, including co-polymers, polymer gels and brushes and charged membranes, wherein he has made theoretical contributions in the areas of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theory for driven dissipative systems, which has resulted in the model with new insights. This work brings in the fundamental concept of random correlated noise for the turbulent fluctuations. This has not been used in this field before.</p> <p>Another pioneering work of Prof V. Kumaran is the lamellar liquid crystalline materials which are widely used in the Food and Cosmetics industry. Prof. Kumaran has formulated a framework for the multiscale modeling of these materials. These are the only models currently available for the rheological behavior of lamellar phases, and have been employed for product design by the two largest Fast Moving Consumer Goods companies in the world, Unilever and Proctor & Gamble.</p> <p>Prof. Kumaran has made some important advances to the Onsager model, by extending the parameter regimes where it can be applied. In particular, the original Onsager model was applicable only to gases whose molecular masses are nearly equal, and for very high rotation speeds. Kumaran's work has been to extend this to lower speeds and to dissimilar gases, such as Carbon Dioxide and Methane, which is of commercial importance in natural gas recovery. The hierarchy of models developed by him provides a comprehensive framework for the development of separation technologies for gases over a range of mass differences.</p> <p>Prof. Kumaran has pioneered the study of transition and turbulence in the flow through soft-walled tubes and channels, an area of immense importance in the fields of cardio-vascular and pulmonary health, as well as for lab-on-a-chip technologies. He was the first to theoretically predict, using sophisticated mathematical techniques, different types of transition to turbulence in soft-walled tubes and channels. These are qualitatively different from, and at flow speeds significantly smaller than, the transition in rigid conduits.</p> <p>His group was also the first to experimentally demonstrate turbulence at small scales and low speeds in the flow past soft surfaces, and show that the turbulence is different from, and more intense than, that in the flow past rigid surfaces. He has proceeded further to translate these scientific advances into innovative technologies for lab-on-a-chip devices for point-of-care diagnostics. This is one of the rare instances where theoretical prediction, experimental discovery and the translation for societal benefit. All of these have been carried out by the same group.</p> <p>His work on flowing granular materials, and the thermodynamics and dynamics of complex fluids including co-polymers as well as the lamellar liquid crystalline materials and the extension of Onsager model reflect his unique talents to combine concepts in fluid mechanics, statistical mechanics and theoretical physics. The fact that much of his work has found practical applications of benefit to society stands as testimony to the quality and utility of his research.</p> <p>""I want to congratulate you on winning the Infosys Prize. The jury was unanimous in your selection and they were really impressed by your work in modelling the flow and transition through soft-wall tubes and its implications for lab-on-a-chip.""</p>","Yes"

It’s the wrong decision!” Jury member Barry Douglas, who was the competition winner in 1986, tweeted “One audience member bounded over to me as I left the building saying 'shame on you' and 'do you think that Lubyantsev is not a good pianist?","'.” “I was walking to a restaurant with Michel Béroff [another juror],” said Douglas, “A woman followed us, chanting ‘Lubyantsev, Lubyantsev’.","<p>More drama from the Tchaikovsky Competition: first, the competition has had to distance itself from racist remarks made by conductor Mark Gorenstein during rehearsals with the Armenian cello finalist, Narek Hakhnazaryan. Second, there's a bit of a stooshie going on at the piano competition. Barry Douglas, the 1986 winner who's on the jury, tweeted a few days ago when the final five were announced, that ""One audience member bounded over to me as I left the building saying 'shame on you' and 'do you think that [Alexander] Lubyantsev is not good pianist?'."" There's more, too. On Monday, he said ""Maestro Gergiev told me he has been contacted by many who are surprised at choice of finalists. The piano jury have been independent & fair"". I spoke to Gergiev earlier that day for Radio 3's Music Matters (you can hear the whole programme on the Tchaikovsky, including interviews with Douglas, Peter Donohoe, Van Cliburn, Freddy Kempf, Anne Sophie-Mutter and Maxim Vengerov on Saturday) and he told me it's not just ""contacting"" that's been going on. There's a bit of pressure, too, from Russian friends of his who feel he should wade in, in his capacity as chairman of the organising committee, and try to change decisions.</p> <p>He won't, and he's right not to, of course: the reputation of the Tchaikovsky Competition is at stake this year, and the judging process has to be perceived to be fair, whatever the outcome. And Barry is undoubtedly right that the jury has been independent in its decision-making. Have a look at the judging guidelines yourself, which are so mathematically and statistically scrupulous you need a PhD to understand them. But I think Gergiev has some sympathy with Lubyantsev and Eduard Kunz, one of the other high-profile Russian casualties. He reminded me that it's not just the winners who win, in terms of the career and reputation they go on to enjoy after the competition. And conversely, he told me that in 1966, only the last-minute intervention of the jury chairman that year, Emil Gilels, meant that Grigory Sokolov was that year's winner. If the audience had had their way, the American Misha Dichter would have won. History has proved Gilels right.</p> <p>This year, Gergiev suggested to me that had there been more Russians on the jury, the outcome might have been different. He also commented ""we cannot ignore the audience's reaction"". Lubyantsev's departure caused the most controversy, as the audience's barracking of Barry shows. (Gergiev also said he would review everything from the composition of the juries to the voting system and the way the rounds work after the competition, and he didn't guarantee he would still be involved for the 2015 edition.) As I've said, based on the Mozart concerto I saw, I don't see how they could have put Lubyantsev through. However, the brilliant thing about this year's competition is the chance to watch all of the earlier rounds, and make your own minds up.</p> <p>There are still two nights left of the finals in all of the instrumental and vocal disciplines. However objective Gergiev and general manager Richard Rodzinski have tried to be, you ain't never going to avoid annoying people in how the competition pans out, and you can't, and shouldn't, try to control the juries you convene. Whatever happens, there will be winners and losers later this week. The big questions are whether the individual prize-winners are worthy victors and go on to stellar careers like some of their predecessors, and whether this year's competition has done enough to save the tarnished reputation of what should be the world's most prestigious classical music competition. We'll know more by Thursday, when the results are announced - keep watching the finals in the meantime!</p>","No"

Her concept-generated and research based practice is concerned with the social and political dimensions of everyday spaces, the strategies to conceptualize resistance, the poetics of ideologies, and the relationship between temporalities and subjectivities. She works individually and collectively across installation, sculpture, painting, performance, participatory events, film, text and writing. She uses exhibition spaces as studios or laboratories where an experimental, itinerant, site-specific performed work can unfold, building improvised actions and choreographed movements. Using art production processes as her point of departure, Bajo works with places as they are given to her and is limited by the materials available in and/or around them. She rearranges these found elements into new compositions, juxtaposing the identities of prefigured social and political spaces and dimensions, creating a, sometimes, cryptic but always revealing new code of signifiers. Bajo presents to her viewers a re-staging of a space and time, of the past, into future events that uses chance, contingency and ambiguity of the moment.</p> <p>Recent solo exhibitions La Femme Radicale or The Point of No Return, 2013, D+T Project Brussels (BE); The Absence of Work, 2012, Platform3, Munich (DE); The Factory of Forms, 2012, Manifesta Parallel, Genk (BE) and group shows Zero Hours, Art Sheffield 2013 Sheffield UK; Original Doubtat Plataforma Revolver, Lisbon; Throw a Rock and see what happens, Casa Encendida, Madrid; Vers une Hypothese Fort Du Bruissin Xll Lyon Biennial Lyon, Material Conceptualism at Anaant and Zoo Gallery, Berlin; Pacific Standard Time, LAXART, 2012, Los Angeles; Perform Now!

Kennedy.","Winstead became interested in Bobby after learning that Anthony Hopkins would appear in the film.","<p>Written and directed by Emilio Estevez, Bobby explores the lives of a diverse cross-section of Americans and how their paths intersect on the fateful day that Bobby Kennedy is assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in a politically turbulent 1968. The powerful ensemble, peppered with some fantastic performances, includes Anthony Hopkins, William H. Macy, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Laurence Fishburne, Martin Sheen, Helen Hunt, Harry Belafonte, Christian Slater, Heather Graham, Joshua Jackson, Elijah Wood, and Lindsay Lohan, among seemingly countless others.</p> <p>A project with a great deal of emotional investment for Estevez, the film has been in the works for some time. Cleverly, it paints a portrait of Bobby Kennedy not by telling his story directly, but by examining the everyday people whose lives he affected.</p> <p>In this interview, three of the youngest cast members--Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Shia LaBeouf, and Brian Geraghty--talk about working on the ambitious undertaking.</p> <p>MEDIA: What was the casting process like for each of you?</p> <p>BRIAN: [laughs] I was like the bottom of the barrel. I auditioned. The casting directors wouldn't let me meet Emilio. I was like, ""Why not?"" And then finally I got that breakdown of the cast, and I was like, ""All right, that's cool."" [laughs] ""If they want me, they want me."" But I went in and I read for them. I just read three scenes, and I just ended up getting an offer... [jokes] I guess I'm just really talented.</p> <p>MARY: For me, I got the script pretty much like any other script. And the only person that I was aware of being attached to it at that point was Anthony Hopkins, so automatically you want to be in the film. [laughs] And after reading the script, I loved the characters, I loved the story, I loved everything about it. And so I was able to meet with Emilio and just kind of sit down and talk to him about it, and I let him know that any role that was available that would suit me, I would do, no matter how big or how small. And then months passed, and every role was filled with like a huge name, including the role that I ended up playing. And at the last second, that person fell out of it, and they called me to show up to work like the next day. So I was really thrown into it, and it was a total whirlwind for me and a shock. But it was great.</p> <p>SHIA: I had just finished working on a film in New York called A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and I was depressed as hell. It was just a tough movie to make. And I came home and I went and visited my dad in Montana...You know, you tell your agent...You make a list when you first start up. You say, ""Look, anything with these people, I'm in. Doesn't matter what the script is, throw me. I'm there in a second."" And this movie had like half the list on it. So I think I said yes even before I had even read the script or met Emilio or anything. As soon as I heard Hopkins' name, that was just instinctual. You're 20 years old, you want to go play for the All-Star team? Sure. So I met with Emilio. I had already said yes, and I was just meeting with him to feel like, ""Yeah, this is pretty cool."" I met with him, and there you have it.</p> <p>Were you in awe at being in a film with so many high-profile actors?</p> <p>SHIA: Absolutely. I remember our first day, we were at the Ambassador Hotel. We sort of kicked off the whole production, it was the first scene, and I remember saying, ""This is strange, man. I don't feel nervous. As big as this sh*t is, I gotta feel nervous. Why am I not feeling nervous?"" And then I think Brian kind of looked like, ""Dude, look over there."" And Hopkins is behind the monitor, and everything just sort of shattered...But then a couple days in, you start hearing things like Hopkins saying, ""You know, William H. Macy's in this movie."" And William H. Macy saying, ""You know, Anthony Hopkins is in this movie."" Or Demi [Moore] saying, ""Sharon Stone's in it!"" And it was just everybody in the same boat. So you felt equal. Of course, [there are] icons, newcomers, legends...It's scatterbrained. But we did all feel like we were on the same team, and we felt equal. So that fear, it was gone.</p> <p>How did you prepare yourselves for the roles of young people living in 1968?</p> <p>MARY: In 1968, my parents were actually about the age that I am now, so I definitely talked to them a lot, at least about the assassination and how it impacted them. And it was interesting just to hear how emotional it was for everyone in the country. I think people our age hear mostly hear about JFK and how that affected everyone, and Bobby Kennedy is just kind of skipped over. So it was kind of surprising just to find out how huge it was for everyone. I think it's strange that we don't learn about that in school, and that he's not focused on, that we don't know how significant he was and important he was in the civil rights movement, and so many things that he did for our country, and that he was going to do. And when he was assassinated, so much got thrown off track, and perhaps we wouldn't be in the same place 30 years later that we were then, if he had [been] elected, which is an assumption. So it was interesting just to find out the importance of his life and his candidacy and everything that he could have become.</p> <p>Do you think your generation today is as politically idealistic as their 1968 counterparts?</p> <p>BRIAN: No.</p> <p>MARY: Not at all, no.</p> <p>BRIAN: We don't have anyone like Bobby Kennedy, really. For our country, that was the last moment of hope. And I think that's Emilio's point of view, too. All these great [leaders]...Martin Luther King and Jack Kennedy, and this was our last one, and now he's gone. And so we didn't know where to go as a country. And I think we're confused as youth today, politically. Because we don't know what to do. We don't know what's right. We don't have these kind of people.</p> <p>SHIA: I think, then, it was also in our face a little more than it is now. We've kind of outsourced our pain so it's not right in front of us. You had assassination after assassination after assassination...It was huge. It was pop culture. It was involved, whereas now, the deaths are in Iraq--it's way far away from our pop culture. And none of my [generation] is watching C-SPAN. They're watching MTV, they're watching American Idol. More people vote for American Idol than the President of the United States. That statement alone is a scary, scary f*cking reality, man.</p> <p>In all likelihood, a political assassination in today's environment probably wouldn't have the same emotional impact as those in the '60s. Why do you suppose that is?</p> <p>SHIA: Then, it wasn't just agreeing with policies. People loved these people, where now, it's just people just agree with their policies. John Kerry, the Democrat side of it, was not what Bobby was. He was a politician. Bobby was a good man. People looked at him like he was a good man. He was a patriot. He didn't kiss kids because the camera was there. It was a different thing. And people followed him. He was a rock star. He was Tony Hawk of politics.</p> <p>Do you think this film can be a catalyst to motivate political interest in young people?</p> <p>BRIAN: I think, yeah.</p> <p>MARY: Yeah. I mean, hopefully, it's sort of inspiring. I think that the youth of America now is very sort of jaded and cynical, and look at politicians as people who can't be trusted, and you can't believe in anyone because everyone has a spin on everything just for political gain. So I hope that we can go back and look and see how it was in 1968, and how young people were idealistic and had hope and had the American Dream, which is kind of gone now. And hopefully it inspires people to try to go back to that in some way, in whatever way we can, [and] to fight for that again.</p> <p>How would you market this film to younger viewers?</p> <p>BRIAN: [jokes] I would tell them that Lindsay Lohan is starring in this film...And then after, we'll do a Q&A tripping on acid.</p>","Yes"
