She moved into a small Victorian house near her husband's residence in Ottawa so she could share custody of their boys. ""I needed to protect my life,"" she says. ""I needed to protect my children."" She and Pierre officially divorced in 1984.</p> <p>From left: Margaret with a busboy at Studio 54, 1979; At a dinner in Ottawa with Prince Charles, 1975; With Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood, 1977</p> <p>Margaret now lives in a comfortable two-bedroom flat in the Ville-Marie section of Montreal. The front door opens onto a hallway lined with photographs arranged in mismatched frames, and her kitchen looks well used. A framed to-do list written by John Lennon (""Put back Sean's large mattress"" and ""Get Margaret Trudeau's book"") stands near a photograph of Margaret and Justin, then a toddler, clambering up airplane steps to greet his father. A bank of windows overlooks nearby Mount Royal; Margaret says she walks in the park there every day, rain or shine, to clear her head. She offers me a cookie. ""This is me,"" she says, waving her arm at the living room cluttered with needlepoint pillows and piles of books, though she tells me she did clear away a toy kitchen set and a few errant Legos left by her grandchildren. ""You get what you see.""</p> <p>Margaret was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2000, and for much of the past decade and a half has devoted herself to raising awareness of mental health issues. She frequently lectures and has written two books addressing the subject. Though her own diagnosis came later in life, Margaret says that she'd long struggled with depression. ""I had my first serious bout with mental illness after the birth of my second child,"" she says. ""It was textbook postpartum depression. I was told I had 'the baby blues.' I was 3,000 miles away from my support system, which had always been my family, and my husband criticized me daily. I was alone. I just thought I was going to live my life as this very desperately sad person, who wept uncontrollably."" She and Pierre agreed that she should seek medical help, but at the time, in 1974, ""no one was yet talking about manic depression, as bipolar illness was then called,"" she says. A girlfriend quietly took Margaret to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, where she was medicated, but she left without a clear understanding of what was wrong.</p> <p>Margaret's waves of sadness were often followed by soaring highs--a condition only exaggerated by her wealth and social position. ""When I was manic, it was grand mania,"" she says. ""Where someone else might have run off with the guy from the 7-Eleven, I ran off with the Rolling Stones. I would spend all my money buying Birkin bags; somebody else would have spent all the grocery money. It's paralyzing either way. You don't have the ability to have a second, sober thought."" She took lithium for a time, but stopped because the medication made her gain weight.</p> <p>""Where someone else might have run off with the guy from the 7-Eleven, I ran off with the Rolling Stones.""</p> <p>Her son Michel's death in an avalanche during a ski trip in 1998 proved a tragic tipping point. Margaret was devastated; the pain of losing a child proved too much to bear. She can remember imploring her doctor to put her into a medically induced coma, ""just to make it stop,"" she says. ""I couldn't deal with it."" Her marriage to her second husband, real estate mogul Fried Kemper, with whom she'd had two more children--a son, Kyle, and a daughter, Alicia--had already begun to unravel, and ended the following year. Pierre, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease, succumbed to cancer not long after--by then he and Margaret had repaired their relationship, and she was at his bedside during his final days. In the months that followed, she dropped 30 pounds and refused to leave the house; her family staged an intervention, which led to her hospitalization and diagnosis.</p> <p>Margaret now monitors herself closely for signs of imbalance. ""A big part of being healthy is making the choice not to be addicted to the mania,"" she says. If she feels an episode coming on, she declares a ""lock-down"" day, ups her medication, and stays home. ""I don't make decisions. I don't get in my car. This one day for me is how a lot of mentally ill people live every day of their lives.""</p> <p>She is close to all of her kids, including Justin, who checks in regularly. Her daughter, Alicia, lives nearby, and they see each other almost daily. Margaret maintains that she won't marry again. ""I was a darling wife when I was good, and when I was bad, I was the worst on the planet,"" she says. She also refuses to allow age to panic her: ""I am almost shocked to see that I have grown old. But I am also amused."" (Her anti-aging advice: ""Get a 25-watt pink bulb and install it in your bathroom."")</p> <p>From left: Escorted by Richard Nixon to a concert in Ottawa, 1972; At Justin's swearing-in ceremony with his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, and their children, 2015; With Pierre, Elizabeth Taylor, and John Warner in Washington, D.C., 1977</p> <p>Last Christmas, her life came to a full--almost spiritual--circle. She and her children were at Harrington Lake, the prime minister's country retreat in Quebec. There was a rare full moon on Christmas Day; she had been in the same place for the last one, in 1977. ""The grandchildren and I were jumping on each other's shadows in the snow,"" she remembers. ""The men--my boys--were playing with swords in the moonlight. It was dream stuff, at this magical place where I had spent so much of my early life with them, and I thought, 'We're back.' I feel I have been given a second chance--who gets a second chance?""</p> <p>This article originally appeared in the April 2016 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.</p> <p>Does Anyone Really ""Make It"" on Their Own?</p> <p>This is the Global Sisterhood You've Always Wanted</p> <p>Cardi B Opens Up About Her Cinderella Story</p> <p>Being Rejected Could Be the Key to Happiness</p> <p>Jennifer Lopez Is (Still) on Top of the World</p> <p>Talk is Chic: Where to Follow Bazaar Editors</p> <p>The Jane Club Is the Ultimate Work Space for Moms</p>","Yes"

In one of BroadwayWorld's newest series, Tails of Broadway, photographer Jessica Fallon Gordon is capturing priceless moments between Broadway's brightest stars and their pets.</p> <p>In this edition, meet Seven- the adorable pooch of Hamilton's Lexi Lawson!</p> <p>How long you've owned: I have owned Seven since she was six weeks old</p> <p>Adoption story: I always wanted a Yorkshire Terrior - in 2008 it was heavily on my mind. One day, out of the blue, a musician colleague said, "" I'm not sure if you like dogs, but I know a Yorkie breeder who has too many yorkies running around her home that her momma yorkie just had."" It was music to my ears ! The next day I went to take a look at the little litter of the cutest full-bred yorkies I have ever seen! They were all so cute! Jumping everywhere with such puppy energy and so new to the world - except Seven. She was too cool for me! She was calm, even tempered, and paid me NO mind. She looked at me, grabbed her moose (which was then way bigger that her) walked away and went back to sleep. I knew she was the one for me. I will never forget the day I took her home. She looked at me, kissed my nose, and feel asleep on my lap in the car while the music played from the radio. We have been best friends ever since.</p> <p>Favorite thing to do with your pet: She is so sweet, so kind and gives LOTS and LOTS of kisses. She has the most personality and is so smart that I really don't have one favorite thing to do with her because everything she does is my favorite and everything we do together is always perfect. I am super lucky because she is a dream dog. A perfect little angel.</p> <p>The naughtiest thing your pet has done: There are three that stand out. She started touring with me when she was months old so now she is a seasoned traveler. I can't say it was all that easy at first. When she was in her ""terrible twos"" she decided it would be a good idea to quietly sneak out of her doggy bag in the airplane and have a joy run - running up and down the aisles while mommy slept OR it was the time I opened my hotel room door after a long show of RENT and little Seven (must have been 5 pounds) pulled the entire wood panel that lined the floor off the wall. Here I am at 2 am glueing and nailing the wood panel back to the wall. Luckily the hotel never noticed OR it was the time at the dog park when this other dog that was slightly bigger than Seven that was messing with her (remember Seven is too cool for anyone) so Seven decided instead of entertaining the other slightly bigger dog - she went up to the biggest dog in the dog park (if I can recall was a doberman pinscher) looked him right in the eye - nose to nose- did some dog communication - The doberman pinscher must have told Seven that he had her back because she trotted back to the dog that was messing with the doberman pinscher following - must have said "" this is the dog thats messing with me"" because the doberman pinscher went right up to that dog and that dog- said its words- and that dog left Seven alone the rest of the time at the dog park.</p> <p>About that moose... she has been carrying the moose around since she was born. It's her blanky and her friend. So (unfortunately for me) I have been buying the same Webkins Moose stuffed animal for her off of Amazon for the last 8 years because I know how much she loves her companion. She must have gone through 50 of them. The only time she puts the moose down is when she eats or goes for a walk- otherwise its either in her mouth or next to her.</p> <p>What would your pet's catch-phrase be? : Me too</p>","Yes"

Not only is she an actress, but Scott has also modeled for Calvin Klein, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Victoria's Secret, among other big-name designers. But Scott is more than just a pretty face. The former Computer Science and Theater double major at Amherst College also designs apps for Apple in her spare time. As a female African American actress, model and tech whiz, Scott has defied stereotypes by achieving success in three different industries. Before her talk at Yale on Saturday, she spoke to WEEKEND about the challenges she's faced in both the modeling and tech worlds, the apps she's developed, and her status as a triple threat.</p> <p>Q. When did you discover that you were interested in computer programming?</p> <p>A. I first did computer programming when I was maybe 13, but at the time, I didn't realize that it was actually computer programming. In school, all the kids were passing around games between their calculators, and I found out that I had the documentation available to figure out how to make those games on my own. So, I started making those games on the TI-89 calculator for myself.</p> <p>Q. And when did you start modeling?</p> <p>A. I started modeling a year after college. I was a computer science and theater major, and at Amherst I dove right into acting. I was doing auditions, but about a year into it, I was discovered by my first modeling agency and started modeling full-time from that day forward. I also did acting, but as I became more and more successful with the modeling, I started devoting more of my time to it.</p> <p>Q. What influenced you, as a computer science major, to go into acting and modeling instead of software engineering?</p> <p>A. I remember my last semester at Amherst, I had this course in compiling. And it was a lot of fun, but there were only three people in that class: me and two other pretty awkward people. I remember thinking that there was no way I could spend my entire life around computer programmers. At the time, I thought there wasn't much diversity in race, gender and personality types in programming, and I didn't think I could be in that kind of environment where I was sitting at my computer, programming excessively, around other people who were sitting at their computers, programming excessively and having awkward conversations. I think it's becoming -- and I hope it continues to become -- a more diverse profession. I hope that more women, more minorities and all different types of people end up getting involved with programming and technology in general. Although I never saw myself pursuing programming after college, I think one reason I love it so much right now is because I make my own schedule, I'm my own boss and I'm able to do projects that appeal to me. But I do have fun hanging with tech people; I'm having dinner with some tech people tonight. There are also some great companies with things like private chefs and private offices where you can customize your own spaces. They give you all the perks. I thought that programming would be suffocating, but the way Google, Facebook and other companies set up their offices creates an enjoyable and non-stressful environment for programmers.</p> <p>Q. At what point after you began modeling did you decide that you wanted to start programming again, as well?</p> <p>A. Well, I'd always played around a bit with code, even after college, just for fun. But once I had my first iPhone, I started downloading the apps and realizing that I could actually make my own apps, so I decided to learn how to do Objective C and iOS programming on my own.</p> <p>Q. How difficult is it to juggle both of your careers?</p> <p>A. It hasn't been difficult to juggle the careers because I'm able to prioritize. If I'm busy working on an app at a certain time then I'll limit the amount of modeling I do, and if good modeling jobs come up then I'll put the app on pause for a bit. I like having that variety, and I haven't had any problems balancing the two careers because I have so much freedom in both to plan my own schedule.</p> <p>Q. Do you ever find yourself enjoying one more than the other?</p> <p>A. No actually, not really. I like doing both and I like that I have that privilege to spend my time doing both things. I do enjoy having more professional freedom as a programmer than I do as a model, though. As a model, my face is basically decided by outside sources -- by the casting directors, by the agents -- it's easy to feel like you're losing control when you're a model. You don't have any control over the jobs that you get. But as a programmer working for myself, I like having complete control over the work I do. I eventually hope to bring more people on board and work with more programmers, graphic designers, etc., but as of now, I do enjoy the freedom that I am given in computer programming, as opposed to the limitations that the modeling industry places on me.</p> <p>Q. Have you faced any challenges in the modeling world as an African-American woman?</p> <p>A. Yeah, definitely. With modeling, it's been very clear. I've had success as a model, but I was shocked when I received my first big job, Calvin Klein Exclusive and found out that I was the first black Calvin Klein Exclusive model to get that contract. I was also the only black person in the show. The same went for Prada and a lot of other clients that I've worked for, where they'll only book one or two black girls at a time. I've definitely been limited by my race in modeling, and the companies don't do anything to disguise it either.</p> <p>Q. How about in the tech world?</p> <p>A. With computer programming, it's not as overt, but I do think that when you don't fit the stereotypical programmer mold, people are less likely to take you seriously. I'm confident in my programming skills and normally if I have a conversation with a programmer, they realize that I'm knowledgeable about what I do. But I think that as a woman, as a person of color and as a model too, it makes people perceive me differently.</p> <p>Q. Have you discovered any interesting similarities between modeling and computer programming, or are they just two vastly different worlds?</p> <p>A. They're both creative outlets for me. I love modeling because I love transforming into different characters, but I also love being able to put my coding to use in order to create apps that I enjoy and that other people would enjoy. For example, I have an app [Code Made Cool] coming out next week  that's ""Code.org meets ASOS."" I've been talking a lot about Code.org lately because they have an amazing website and a great interface where people can learn how to program by dragging and dropping software code. And I'm also on the cover of this upcoming month's ASOS magazine. So I decided as a supplement to the magazine release, I would put together a ""Code.org meets ASOS"" app that young people could use to help them learn programming by dragging and dropping bits of code to make their way through fantasy scenarios with a parodied Ryan Gosling. I'm excited for that to come out in a few days. Having an idea pop into my head and then being able to program it in a few weeks and share it with other people -- that sort of creativity is nice to express through programming.</p> <p>Q. Can you tell me about some of the other apps you've developed?</p> <p>A. I have three other apps in the App Store. My first app is called Educate, based on an organization that was founded by a group of Amherst students in order to create a program to mentor Ugandan youths and help them become leaders and entrepreneurs. As of now, Uganda has the world's youngest population, but it also has one of the largest unemployed populations. I decided to make an app where people could donate directly to the organization Educate, which would then donate this money to the Ugandans, to provide them with the tools they need to build up their country. My second app is iPort, a portfolio app for models and other artists. It's a fully customizable portfolio that I made to mimic the traditional modeling portfolio book where you can customize the book cover, the background, logo, etc., and flip through the pages like you would a traditional portfolio. But it can be stored on an iPod and allows you to keep multiple portfolios on the same device. I made it specifically for me to have an easy way to keep many portfolios on hand at one time, and be able to share them conveniently through the app. My third app is The Matchmaker, a social networking app where you enter in your profile information, match criteria and personality traits, and if you're walking down the street and pass by someone who's compatible with you in love, friendship or business, it alerts you and lets you know that it's someone you should be talking to. And the last app is the Code Made Cool App, which should be coming out next week.</p> <p>Q. It's interesting that you were able to design an app like iPort, which actually helped you with your modeling career. Do you know other models that utilize the app as well?</p> <p>A. I do know other models that use it, but I also know that people all over the world have been using the app for many different purposes that I never expected it to be used for. For example, I've heard of people using it for cake making, to show off their different cakes. I also have a meeting with Models.com tomorrow, where we're going to do an interview and talk about the app. I've been trying to arrange a meeting with Models.com for a while, and I'm happy that I'll finally be able to talk to them, which will hopefully result in more industry people adopting the app and using it as a replacement for the traditional portfolio. In a lot of ways, it's actually better than the traditional portfolio, especially since I'll soon be incorporating video into it as well.</p> <p>Q. Where do you see yourself in the future? You already touched on this briefly, but do you plan on increasing the amount of programming you do or programming at a larger scale?</p> <p>A. In general, I like maintaining the freedom in my life to do things that appeal to me and I'm really fortunate that at this time, I'm able to do modeling, acting and programming in a way that suits my schedule and my interests. I just have to make sure that everything I'm doing now, I'm doing to the best of my abilities.</p> <p>Q. Do you have any advice for people looking to go into computer programming?</p> <p>A. With computer programming, Code.org is a great place to get started if you don't have any coding experience. One, it directs you to many other programming resources and two, it's a really fun way to get into it. I think they have an Angry Birds game where you can drag and drop code to manipulate the Angry Birds characters while teaching you core programming concepts. A lot of people are afraid of computer programming because the terminology and ideas people use when describing it sound so foreign, but computer science is becoming a part of every single industry. I think it's important for everyone to have some sort of idea of the science that goes into the technology we use on an everyday basis. So I suggest that people give it a try and see what it is, and I think it'll surprise them because it's actually a lot of fun.</p> <p>Q. And do you have advice for people looking to go into modeling?</p> <p>A. That's a lot harder. Models are genetic freaks, for the most part. Modeling is something people go into when they have these weird long limbs and long bodies, and are skinny and awkward. And even if you have all these qualities and are one of these genetic freaks, it's still hard for me to recommend it as a career path because it takes a lot of luck in order to compete in modeling. I see it all the time -- the most incredible women who are beautiful and confident in themselves end up sitting at home on their couches all day, and have a terrible time in the business because they're unable to get jobs. So even if you have all the qualities on the surface that it takes to be a model, there are so many factors outside of yourself that are involved that no matter how hard you work, a great career in modeling isn't always achievable. I definitely recommend that if you like modeling, you should take pictures and try to create art in this way -- through your modeling -- but don't necessarily go into it thinking that it will be a sustainable career.</p>","Yes"

But the cross was as inviting as a bath of warm cream on a cold day and the German striker's miss in the second half was the greatest gaffe of the game. In the end both were overshadowed by Christine Sinclair's sumptuous second-half free-kick anyway. More of that and there'll be no need to talk about keepers. But in all likelihood the No1's will be in the spotlight throughout the tournament. It would be nice if they could go some way to killing the cliche.</p> <p>This tournament will be Bardsley's first as England's No1, having been back-up to Rachel Brown at Euro 2009.

That has to be a good thing.</p> <p>* ""Homosexuality is a dirty thing, spiritually and morally it is very, very wrong."" Nigeria coach Eucharia Uche's astonishing outburst quoted in Bild on the eve of the tournament certainly overshadowed the Super Falcons' preparations for the tournament.

He went</p> <p>undefeated four times and won an unprecedented four state championships. When</p> <p>he left for Harvard, more than a few people, including Jantzen, expected him to</p> <p>win at least one NCAA crown.</p> <p>Finally, in his last go-round, it happened.</p> <p>Jantzen is on top of the country.</p> <p>Skretkowicz shines.

He was the first 4x State Champion and 6x state place winner in New York State wrestling history.","He is still the only 4x single state champion in New York history, was a 3x High School All-American and 2x National Champion/Outstanding Wrestler award winner.","<p>Of all the moves, all the skills and all the talents that Jesse Jantzen acquired over the course of his great wrestling career, it might come as a surprise to hear what he considered to be the most valuable tool in his toolbox: humility.</p> <p>""I think you need to be humble in your life,"" Jantzen said. ""You can be confident, but need to be confident with a certain level of humility. You have to know what your ability is. You have to know what your shortcomings are.""</p> <p>Shortcomings? Jantzen didn't have many of those. That only makes his appreciation of humility all the more impressive.</p> <p>Jantzen was a dominant force on the wrestling mat. The former Shoreham-Wading River High School star was a four-time New York State champion. He was the state's winningest wrestler at the time of his high school graduation. He became a three-time all-American and an NCAA Division I champion at Harvard University. He was a World University Games champion.</p> <p>Humility, as well as confidence, played a role in all of that. A wrestler needs humility, confidence and a healthy balance between the two. It can be a delicate balance, to be sure, but Jantzen found the right mix.</p> <p>Jantzen, 29, can trace his humility to his parents, Don and Deborah. It is in his nature. ""I never thought I was good enough to act any other way, to be honest with you,"" he said. ""There's always someone who's better than you.""</p> <p>Not many were better than Jantzen. New York had never seen a high school wrestler like him before. With the notable exception of a place on the United States Olympic team, Jantzen squeezed about as much as he could out of a full wrestling career. His wrestling exploits are legend and his name became nationally known.</p> <p>Jesse Jantzen was introduced to the sport that his name later became synonymous with as a youngster around kindergarten age when his father brought him to a kid wrestling session at Rocky Point High School. It was there where he met his future best friend, Mike Torriero. Those two were part of quite a training trio at the time along with Steve Broglie. Torriero would go on to become a high school all-American for Rocky Point and then a wrestler at West Virginia. As a wrestler for Mount Sinai, Broglie became a Suffolk County champion.</p> <p>Wrestling suited Jantzen well. By the time he was 9 years old, he won a state freestyle tournament. Meanwhile, he was being exposed to top-notch instruction. He attended clinics and camps that featured accomplished wrestlers like Olympic gold medalists Dan Gable and Kevin Jackson.</p> <p>""He got to see the Mickey Mantles of wrestling,"" said Don Jantzen.</p> <p>And then there was instruction from Don Jantzen himself, a 1972 county champion for Comsewogue who later wrestled at C. W. Post, and then coached Comsewogue and Shoreham-Wading River.</p> <p>Described as fanatical about his workouts, Jesse Jantzen was determined not to be outworked by any opponent. Dan Miracola, a former Shoreham teammate of Jantzen's, said: ""He puts so much time in. No matter how hard you work, he's working a little bit harder than you.""</p> <p>Jantzen progressed quickly. When he was in seventh grade, he skipped middle school wrestling and was bumped right up to the varsity team.</p> <p>""As we got older, we went to bigger and bigger tournaments,"" Torriero said, ""They seemed to get tougher and tougher for me, and easier and easier for him. He was ready for the varsity level when he was a third-, fourth-grader. He was ready for the state and national level when he was a seventh-grader.""</p> <p>Don Jantzen, who was an assistant coach for the Wildcats at the time, kept a watchful eye over his seventh-grade son in the state tournament in 1995. It might have been with a little concern that Don Jantzen watched 12-year-old Jesse, wearing braces, step on the mat in the match for third place at 96 pounds.</p> <p>""I'm like, 'Oh my God, I hope he doesn't break him,"" Don Jantzen said. ""The guy he's wrestling really looks like a man.""</p> <p>Jesse Jantzen won that bout, capping a 28-2 season that saw him become the first seventh-grader to win a Suffolk championship. It was the start of a wondrous time for Jantzen and the Wildcats.</p> <p>""His high school career was nothing I or anyone else could have dreamed of,"" said Don Jantzen.</p> <p>Although it didn't happen much and he tried to keep his composure in public when it did happen, Jesse Jantzen said he didn't handle losing well early on. ""It ate at me,"" he said. ""I hated it. It pissed me off.""</p> <p>While it was rare for Jantzen not to have his arm raised by the referee after a match, Torriero saw how losses affected Jantzen. ""Those things stung like hornets,"" said Torriero.</p> <p>Don Jantzen said: ""Wrestling is one of those sports [in which] the difference between winning and losing is so drastic. When you lose it hurts. It was difficult. It was emotional. It was an open wound.""</p> <p>But Jantzen turned his losses into a positive. They motivated him to train harder.</p> <p>Jantzen won his first 16 bouts that freshman season before he suffered a loss to a defending league champion from Rocky Point, who pinned him with one second left in the third period. The following morning, Don Jantzen noticed a newspaper clipping hanging on a mirror in Jesse's room with a headline that included the words ""Jantzen Pinned.""</p> <p>When Jesse was later asked about it, he told his father: ""I put up [a story] that I was pinned. That's not going to happen again.""</p> <p>It didn't. That was the last time Jantzen was pinned in high school.</p> <p>Wrestling at 112 pounds, Jantzen was a repeat league and county champion and took third in the state once again as an eighth-grader.</p> <p>Paul Jendrewski, Shoreham's coach at the time, didn't realize how dominant Jantzen would be when he first saw him as a sixth-grader, but he was finding out. Making good use of innovative takedowns and the crab ride, Jantzen controlled bouts.</p> <p>""He went out there with just fearlessness,"" Jendrewski said. ""I hadn't seen anybody better than him on their feet. He could take people down with a flick of the hand. That whistle [blew], and he was on you.""</p> <p>Jantzen lost only one of his 33 bouts as an eighth-grader -- in a state semifinal. It was his last loss in high school.</p> <p>From that point on, the wins piled up as Jantzen improved and added state titles to his resume. He went 37-0 as a freshman at 125 pounds, 41-0 as a sophomore at 135, and 36-0 as a junior at 145.</p> <p>By the time Jantzen completed his junior year, he had passed Adam Mariano of Comsewogue as Long Island's winningest wrestler and became one of 11 New York wrestlers to have won three state championships.</p> <p>Heading into his senior season, the aim was for a fourth state title. It had never been done before. Could he do it?</p> <p>Jantzen's wrestling was scrutinized that season. Three matches would be going on at once in tournaments, and all eyes were focused on one mat -- the one Jantzen was wrestling on. One newspaper reporter wrote that critiquing Jantzen is like trying to find a flaw in Superman, stating that Jantzen is about as close to wrestling perfection as they come. It got to a point that if Jantzen made one slip in a match, it was a big deal.</p> <p>Because they were so one-sided, Jantzen's matches weren't always the most exciting to watch, though. He was so superior to many opponents that he threw down like a rag doll and routinely controlled bouts from start to finish, making it look almost effortless.</p> <p>Jantzen finished his quest in style. In the state tournament at the Onondaga War Memorial in Syracuse, he breezed into the 145-pound final by recording three first-period pins in a total time of 2 minutes 48 seconds. Then, in the title bout, Jantzen stopped Ben Morczek of South Lewis by technical fall at 2:08 to become the first four-time state champion in New York history.</p> <p>""It was the most remarkable thing that ever happened in the State of New York in wrestling,"" Torriero said. ""He's the Roger Bannister of wrestling. It couldn't get done, it couldn't get done. He did it.""</p> <p>While the capacity crowd of 7,113 erupted into cheers, Jantzen leaped into the arms of Jendrewski and then hugged his father. Meanwhile, the crowd began a chant of ""Jesse! Jesse!"" and gave him a two-minute standing ovation.</p> <p>""It was a moment to be cherished,"" said Jendrewski.</p> <p>Afterward, Jantzen said: ""It was pretty exciting. I just wanted to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes and wrestled as well as I could. I didn't want to go out with any regrets.""</p> <p>He acknowledged that he had felt butterflies, saying, ""There was a lot riding on this.""</p> <p>Don Jantzen recalled it as a surreal moment. ""It seemed like every time he did something amazing or spectacular or that seemed like the climbing of Mount Everest, the next major event he'd outdo that one,"" he said.</p> <p>The victory extended a state record win streak to 157. All but one of his wins that senior season came by pins or technical falls. He also finished high school with six league and six county titles (something no one else has ever done) to go with his four state crowns. One upstate New York newspaper hailed him as ""The Mat King.""</p> <p>Three days later, Shoreham-Wading River High School celebrated ""Jesse Jantzen Day"" in recognition of the milestone. Speaking before an assembly of students in the school auditorium, the principal, Joe Hayward, told Jantzen, ""You are our hero and our champion.""</p> <p>Four state titles put Jantzen in a class of his own at the time. Two wrestlers -- J. P. O'Connor of Oxford (2003-6) and Alex Ekstrom of Palmyra Macedon (2006-9) -- have since joined him as New York's only four-time champions.</p> <p>John Lange had been the first Suffolk wrestler to win three state titles when he did so for Longwood from 1992-94. When Jantzen's name was brought up during an interview last week, Lange, who later won a Big 10 championship while wrestling for Penn State, joked: ""Damn him. Thanks to that guy, nobody remembers me.""</p> <p>Before Jantzen graduated from high school, though, he had some final business to attend to, a national tournament in Pittsburgh.</p> <p>In a tournament that Don Jantzen said included a who's who of top wrestlers, his son pinned every one of his opponents to win it.</p> <p>Jantzen's career high school record was a remarkable 221-3, placing him second on Suffolk's all-time win list behind Stephen Dutton, who accumulated 226 wins for Rocky Point and Hauppauge before graduating in 2010. Jantzen was named the 2000 Asics National High School Wrestler of the Year, and also became a junior national champion that year.</p> <p>When it came time to select a college, Jantzen picked Harvard. Aside from the school's outstanding academic reputation, one of the factors that influenced Jantzen's decision was Andy McNerney, a friend, Shoreham graduate and former Harvard wrestler who was serving as a volunteer assistant coach for the Crimson as the time.</p> <p>As with all freshmen wrestlers, the college level was an adjustment for Jantzen, but he soon adapted to life in Cambridge, Mass., and was the Ivy League Rookie of the Year. After four seasons at Harvard, Jantzen had become the most decorated wrestler in school history. He capped his senior season in 2004 by winning the NCAA title at 149 pounds and being named the NCAA Most Outstanding Wrestler and the Ivy League Wrestler of the Year, with a 38-1 record. It was also the third straight year in which he was honored as an all-American. Along the way, Jantzen was a three-time conference champion and made the all-Ivy League first team in each of his four years.</p> <p>Jantzen became Harvard's first national champion in 66 years. With John Harkness, who was a national champion for Harvard in 1938, in the crowd at the Saavis Center in St. Louis, cheering him on, the top-seeded Jantzen finally achieved the NCAA title that had eluded him the previous three years. He defeated Oklahoma State sophomore Zach Esposito, 9-3, and was named the tournament's most outstanding wrestler. When the match was over, Jantzen threw off his headgear and held up his arms in triumphant fashion.</p> <p>""It feels incredible,"" Jantzen, who went 131-13 in college, told ESPN2 after the match. ""My whole four years, it's been my goal. ... Taking third twice, it's been tough on me. It's been kind of a burden, and this was my year.""</p> <p>Jantzen didn't lose a match at 149 pounds that entire season. His only loss came when he moved up a class to 157 against Alex Tirapelle of Illinois.</p> <p>After graduating from Harvard, Jantzen looked ahead to a wrestling future that he hoped would land him in the Olympics. He concentrated on freestyle wrestling and trained for several years at Harvard while serving as an assistant coach for the Crimson.</p> <p>In 2005, Jantzen took fourth place in the World Team Trials and sixth place in the U. S. Senior National Championships. He also competed for the New York Outrage team in the first season of RealPro Wrestling.</p> <p>But possibly the most significant triumph of his career also came that year when he won a gold medal at the World University Games in Turkey. In the prestigious tournament, which is open to wrestlers under the age of 28, Jantzen defeated Kelaxsaev Berding of Russia, 4-0, 2-0, in the finals, becoming only the third American to finish first in the tournament. He was impressive.</p> <p>Not only did Jantzen not lose a single period in the entire tournament, but he shut out his opponents in seven of 10 periods.</p> <p>Then, after the World University Games, Jantzen suffered a huge setback, tearing a ligament in his right foot. The injury was misdiagnosed, Jantzen said, and kept him out of wrestling for about a year and a half. ""It ended up being a little bit of a debacle,"" he said.</p> <p>When Jantzen came back, he pursued his Olympic dream. However, not only did the foot injury set him back, but he came down with food poisoning a week before the Olympic Trials in Las Vegas.</p> <p>""I looked like [garbage], for lack of a better word,"" he said. ""My body was hurting. I was vomiting and everything.""</p> <p>Not surprisingly, considering the condition he was in, Jantzen didn't make the team. He believes that on his best day, he could have been an Olympian.</p> <p>That marked the end of competitive wrestling for Jantzen.</p> <p>""It was difficult,"" he said. ""I'm sure I spent a couple of days sobbing like a little baby, but there's a lot of worse things that can happen.""</p> <p>Torriero said: ""That foot injury threw a major monkey wrench into the plans. It was devastating for all of us.""</p> <p>Eventually, Jantzen traded in his wrestling singlet for a business suit. He now lives and works in New York City, working for a hedge fund.</p> <p>Torriero said it was tough for Jantzen to walk away from wrestling.</p> <p>""I think he lost a part of his identity,"" Torriero said. ""It's like being a dragon slayer and there are no more dragons to slay.""</p> <p>Jantzen still maintains a connection to wrestling, though. He goes to camps and works out with his younger brother, Corey, who himself is a two-time state champion entering his senior year as a Harvard wrestler. (The Jantzen brothers aren't the only athletes in the family. One sister, Doni-Melissa, was a two-time field hockey All-American for Hofstra University. Another sister, Debi-Michelle, who will enter her senior year at Shoreham-Wading River High School next month, is a member of the junior national field hockey team.) But Jesse Jantzen said his real passion now is wakeboarding.</p> <p>Aside from his absolute dominance in wrestling, some also remember Jesse Jantzen best for his sportsmanship and respectful manner.</p> <p>""He had a lot of success,"" Torriero said. ""He definitely could have let that have gone to his head and be arrogant and cocky and brash, and he didn't. He treated everybody the same. Whether you were a two-win junior varsity wrestler or a state champion, he treated you the same.""</p> <p>Jantzen said he doesn't spend a lot of time reflecting on what he did in wrestling.</p> <p>""I appreciate the time that I had to have fun and compete in the sport that I love,"" he said. ""When you look back, I guess you do realize it was a lot fun.""</p>","Yes"

Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.","He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, and he is left-handed.","<p>It might include the time he and several Harvard Law School classmates played inmates at a Massachusetts prison; the students were terrified to win or lose, because the convicts lining the court had bet on both outcomes. (""I got two packs on you!"" they called out.)</p> <p>Cut to the future Mrs. Obama asking her brother to take her new boyfriend out on the court, to make sure he was not the type to hog the ball or call constant fouls. The reel might then show Mr. Obama, an Illinois Democrat, playing with former NBA stars in a tournament fund-raiser for his Senate campaign, and at the family gatherings that always seem to end with everyone out by the hoop next to the garage.</p> <p>Basketball has little to do with Mr. Obama's presidential bid -- in fact, he has trouble finding time to shoot baskets anymore  --  but until recently, it was one of the few constants in his life.</p> <p>At first, it was a tutorial in race, a way for a kid with a white mother, a Kenyan father and a peripatetic childhood to establish the African-American identity that he longed for. In ""Dreams From My Father,"" Mr. Obama described basketball as a comfort to a boy whose father was mostly absent, and who was one of only a few black youths at his school. ""At least on the basketball court I could find a community of sorts,"" he wrote.</p> <p>Craig Robinson, Mr. Obama's brother-in-law, said: ""He didn't know who he was until he found basketball. It was the first time he really met black people.""</p> <p>Now, Mr. Obama's friends say, basketball has been his escape from the sport of politics, but also a purer version of it, with no decorous speeches, no careful consensus -- just unrestrained competition.</p> <p>""He can be himself, it's a safe haven, he can let his competitive juices flow and tease his buddies,"" Mr. Nesbitt said. ""It's just a relaxing respite from the every-moment and every-word scrutinization that he gets.""</p> <p>Before Rickey Green, a former NBA all-star, played with Mr. Obama in a 2004 Senate campaign fund-raiser, ""I didn't think he could play at all, to be honest with you,"" Mr. Green said. But ""he's above average,"" for a pickup player, Mr. Green said. ""He's got a nice little left-hand shot and some knowledge of the game.""</p> <p>Mr. Robinson, now the coach of Brown University's men's team, said the 6-foot-2 senator is too skinny to be an imposing presence, but he is fast, with good wind even when he was a smoker. Mr. Obama is left-handed, and his signature move is to fake right and veer left, surprising players used to guarding right-handed competitors.</p> <p>On the court, Mr. Obama is confident, even a bit boastful.</p> <p>""If he would hit a couple buckets, he would let you know about it,"" said Alexi Giannoulias, who played in the late 1990s with Mr. Obama at the East Bank Club, a luxurious spot in downtown Chicago.</p> <p>He is gentleman enough to call fouls on himself: Steven Donziger, a law school classmate, has heard Mr. Obama mutter, ""my bad,"" tossing the other team the ball.</p> <p>But ""he knew how to get in the mix when he needed to,"" Mr. Giannoulias said. ""There are always elbows, there's always a little bit of jersey tucking and tugging,"" he said, continuing, ""Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to win.""</p> <p>The men -- and it is generally men -- who play with Mr. Obama are not, they will have you know, the paunchy, lumbering type. ""Most of the guys who played in our little circle are former players in college or pros,"" said Mr. Robinson, who is still Princeton's fourth-leading scorer of all time. ""They're real high level.""</p> <p>Mr. Obama cannot match their technical prowess, say those who played regularly with him. But he is fiercely competitive, and makes up for his deficits with collaboration and strategy. ""He's very good at finding a way to win when he's playing with people who are supposedly stronger,"" Mr. Nesbitt said.</p> <p>At country clubs across the land, politicians network and raise money over rounds of golf, a sport Mr. Obama also plays. But Chicago is a basketball town, and over the years, Mr. Obama's gymmates have become loyal allies and generous backers.</p> <p>Mr. Nesbitt, an owner and executive at an airport parking company and chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority's board of commissioners, helped Mr. Obama get to know Penny Pritzker, who is now his national finance chairwoman.</p> <p>Arne Duncan, a top Chicago public school official, is helping with Mr. Obama's education platform.</p> <p>Mr. Giannoulias met Mr. Obama on the court, and thanks in part to his backing, is now the Illinois state treasurer. Other regular gymmates include the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the director of the Illinois Department of Public Health and several investment bankers who were early and energetic fund-raisers.</p> <p>Though some of these men could afford to build courts at their own homes, they pride themselves on the democratic nature of basketball, on showing up at South Side parks and playing with whoever is around. At the University of Chicago court where he and Mr. Obama used to play, ""You might have someone from the street and a potential Nobel Prize winner on the same team,"" Mr. Duncan said. ""It's a great equalizer.""</p> <p>It is a theme that runs throughout Mr. Obama's basketball career: a desire to be perceived as a regular guy despite great advantage and success. As a teenager, he slipped away from his tony school to university courts populated by ""gym rats and has-beens"" who taught him ""that respect came from what you did and not who your daddy was,"" Mr. Obama wrote.</p> <p>Later, the Harvard game against the prison inmates, said Hill Harper, who organized it, was intended to show them that ""we support you, we're not removed from everything going on.""</p> <p>But the easy friendships Mr. Obama once struck up on the court are a thing of the past. Lately, the rule in the family is ""No more new friends,"" Mr. Robinson said. ""You don't know what people's real agendas are.""</p> <p>Now, for exercise, Mr. Obama pounds treadmills at hotel gyms. He played a bit last year, with American troops on military bases in Kuwait and Djibouti, and again at Christmas. His staff members laugh when asked if the senator has had any playing time since coming to Washington or hitting the campaign trail. (""I dream of playing basketball,"" Mr. Obama said in a television interview on Tuesday.) Before the first Democratic debate in South Carolina, Mr. Robinson reserved a court and a slot on Mr. Obama's schedule, hoping the candidate could blow off some steam before the big night.

Formally, their collective had a short life, 1959–61, and showed together as a group only three times. It was the culmination of nearly a decade of work, friendships, writing, lectures, sojourns and shows in Paris and New York, as well as local exhibitions. The group coalesced around Galería Color-Luz (Color-Light), which was started in Havana in 1957 by es:Lolo Soldevilla (1901–1971), just after she returned from several years in Paris as Cuba's cultural attaché. She was an artist with energy to burn, judging by the works representing her here. Her partner in the effort, another member of the 10, was Pedro de Oraá, an artist, poet and art critic, born in 1931, who would write a short history of the group.","That's why since his youth Josignacio only through art books was influenced by the abstract expressionists of the New York School (art); especially Jackson Pollock from whom he got the use of dripping and pouring paint on canvases but with pigmented epoxy resins instead of alkyd enamels, however, Dutch painter Karel Appel faces and Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky mix of colors
have had a special focus.","<p>The Hague -- ""After the death of an artist, you can have a new look, a fresh look, and suddenly you can see things that you didn't see before,"" Franz Kaiser, the curator of a retrospective of work by the Dutch artist Karel Appel at the Gemeentemuseum here, said as he walked past Appel's deceptively childlike early canvases and sculpture.</p> <p>Appel, who died in 2006 at 85, seemed destined to have a respected but not transcendent career. His involvement with CoBrA, a short-lived postwar avant-garde movement in northern Europe, attracted a flurry of attention, and he made a splash in New York in the late 1950s. But later works were received more coolly as tastes shifted away from paint on canvas.</p> <p>Now, thanks largely to the Karel Appel Foundation, established in Amsterdam in 1999 by Appel, Mr. Kaiser and others, Appel's art has returned to the public eye and research supported by the foundation has introduced new ways of thinking about the artist. That research informs the Gemeentemuseum retrospective, part of a surprisingly fertile run of Appel exhibitions that started in New York in 2014 with a show at the gallery Blum & Poe.</p> <p>""I'm tackling two cliches,"" said Mr. Kaiser, the Gemeentemuseum's director of exhibitions. ""One is that Appel was always identified with CoBrA and the other one is that Karel was 'just messing around""' -- a reference to the artist's own description of his work.</p>","No"

Love Arcade was eventually signed to Atlantic and released a self-titled album in 2006, on which Berishaj was the sole performer.

Usually when you''re shoved and land on your face you''re not shoved in the front.""</p> <p>At one point, Turner went far onto the field to voice a complaint. Though he never has been called for unsportsmanlike conduct, Turner said he got close Saturday.</p> <p>""He told me to get back,"" Turner said. ""He actually reached (for his penalty flag), so I thought I was going to get my first flag. Big Ten guys wouldn''t do it. I''ve had them reach a few times. I''ve had them say, ''What did you say?'' and I had to change what I said.""</p> <p>Watching the film didn''t change Turner''s impression of his team''s effort against Missouri.</p> <p>""I loved our attitude,"" Turner said. ""We were playing with great intensity. Defensively, we were flying better than I''ve ever seen since I''ve been here. We played pretty well defensively. Offensively, we were flying around, too. We just made some mistakes.""</p> <p>Illinois outgained Missouri by 188 yards. Most times that would be enough for a win.</p> <p>""Normally, unless you turn the ball over and get a punt blocked,"" Turner said. ""If you make those big mistakes and they don''t make any, then you''re going to be in trouble.""</p> <p>The helmets were flying off at a record pace Saturday, Illinois linebackers Sinclair and Antonio Mason among the players losing their head protection during tackles.</p> <p>""I don''t know why,"" Turner said. ""If it keeps happening, we''ll have to look at the helmets. But I think it was just a coincidence.""</p> <p>The top four Illinois receivers from the 2002 season all have made NFL rosters. Philadelphia''s Greg Lewis and Indianapolis'' Aaron Moorehead, who signed as free agents, both found out this weekend they had made the cut. Draftees Walter Young (Carolina) and Brandon Lloyd (San Francisco) both are vying for spots in their rotations.</p> <p>""I''m happy for those guys,"" Turner said. ""Two of those guys (Lewis and Moorehead) are former walk-ons. I think that''s going to help people here and help with recruiting. It will send a message to Lonnie (Hurst) and Kelvin (Hayden) and those guys that if you do what we ask you to do and do it our way, you''re going to get into camp and you''re going to have a head start. I believe that''s helped them.""</p> <p>You can reach Bob Asmussen at (217) 351-5233 or via e-mail at rasmusse@news-gazette.com.</p>","No"

Application for rehearing may be filed within the delay allowed by Art. 922, La. C. Cr.P. No. 46,404-KA COURT OF APPEAL SECOND CIRCUIT STATE OF LOUISIANA  *****  STATE OF LOUISIANA  Appellee versus  RANDALL WAYNE ROCKETT  Appellant  ***** Appealed from the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana Trial Court No. 177,346 Honorable Michael Owens Craig, Judge *****  LOUISIANA APPELLATE PROJECT By: Paula Corley Marx  Counsel for Appellant  JOHN SCHUYLER MARVIN District Attorney  Counsel for Appellee  JOHN M. LAWRENCE ROBERT RANDALL SMITH Assistant District Attorneys *****  Before BROWN, DREW and LOLLEY, JJ. DREW, J.: Randall Wayne Rockett pled guilty to DWI, fourth offense, and was sentenced to 25 years at hard labor. He now appeals his sentence. We affirm in all respects. FACTS On November 4, 2009, a hit-and-run occurred on East Texas Street in Bossier City. A dark colored S-10 pickup truck1 swerved into the wrong lane, struck a car on the passenger side, and left the scene. The victims called police via cell phone and followed the truck for several blocks until it was located by police. Defendant    s speech was slurred and he smelled of liquor. During a frisk, a bottle of whiskey was found on him. He was arrested for DWI, hit and run, resisting an officer, and open container violation. To subdue him, the officers had to use physical force and chemical spray. He refused to participate in any field sobriety tests. To avoid facing habitual offender charges, Rockett pled guilty as charged to DWI, fourth offense,2 in violation of La. R.S. 14:98(E). The bill noted three previous convictions.3 The court ordered a presentence investigation (    PSI    ). 1  The cell phone report was that the truck was being operated by a white male, wearing glasses and a multi-colored shirt, on East Texas Street (U.S. Highway 80) in Bossier City, a description matching that of the defendant. 2  3  The state dismissed all other pending charges. May 13, 1998, DWI, in the Twenty-Sixth JDC, Docket No. 88,435; June 31, 2001, DWI, in the Twenty-Sixth JDC, Docket No. 108,087; and February 14, 2002, DWI, in the First JDC, Docket No. 216,977. At sentencing, the court carefully reviewed the PSI, which outlined Rockett    s criminal history, noting that this was actually at least his seventh DWI conviction. Other convictions included simple battery, criminal trespass, disturbing the peace, and issuing worthless checks. On his previous DWI convictions, Rockett had usually received leniency. He often violated his probation or parole by continuing to drive under the influence, as was the case here. At sentencing, the court found that:   C/  no mitigating factors existed;    C/  Rockett was a danger to himself and to the general public;    C/  he would likely commit another crime if allowed probation; and    C/  a lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of this crime.4  The defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence, alleging the excessiveness of his sentence. He also filed a pro se     Motion For Order For Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program. Both motions were denied. The defendant assigns two related matters as errors by the trial court:   C/  inadequate consideration of La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1, and    C/  the unconstitutionality and excessiveness of this sentence. Defendant argues that:   C/  4  the trial court failed to explore substance abuse treatment options;  The sentence was ordered to be served consecutively with any other sentence. 2     C/  the court failed to consider defendant    s age and the fact that there was no injury or major damage from the accident; and    C/  this sentence was nothing more than needless infliction of pain and suffering. Unsurprisingly, the state disagrees. Our law on the review of sentences is well settled.5 The court adequately considered the PSI and the factors of La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1. Defendant is a dangerous recidivist. Sadly, his recent pro se motion is his only known request for substance abuse treatment, despite his lengthy criminal record, almost all of which involved alcohol. 5  An appellate court utilizes a two-pronged test in reviewing a sentence for excessiveness. First, the record must show that the trial court took cognizance of the criteria set forth in La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1. The trial judge is not required to list every aggravating or mitigating circumstance so long as the record reflects that he adequately considered the guidelines of the article. State v. Smith, 433 So. 2d 688 (La. 1983); State v. Lathan, 41,855 (La. App. 2d Cir. 2/28/07), 953 So. 2d 890, writ denied, 2007-0805 (La. 3/28/08), 978 So. 2d 297. The articulation of the factual basis for a sentence is the goal of La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1, not rigid or mechanical compliance with its provisions. Where the record clearly shows an adequate factual basis for the sentence imposed, remand is unnecessary even where there has not been full compliance with La. C. Cr. P. art. 894.1. State v. Lanclos, 419 So. 2d 475 (La. 1982); State v. Swayzer, 43,350 (La. App. 2d Cir. 8/13/08), 989 So. 2d 267, writ denied, 2008-2697 (La. 9/18/09), 17 So. 3d 388. The important elements which should be considered are the defendant    s personal history (age, family ties, marital status, health, employment record), prior criminal record, seriousness of offense, and the likelihood of rehabilitation. State v. Jones, 398 So. 2d 1049 (La. 1981); State v. Ates, 43,327 (La. App. 2d Cir. 8/13/08), 989 So. 2d 259, writ denied, 2008-2341 (La. 5/15/09), 8 So. 3d 581. There is no requirement that specific matters be given any particular weight at sentencing. State v. Shumaker, 41,547 (La. App. 2d Cir. 12/13/06), 945 So. 2d 277, writ denied, 2007-0144 (La. 9/28/07), 964 So. 2d 351. Second, the court must examine whether the sentence is too severe considering the circumstances of the case and the background of the defendant. A sentence violates La. Const. Art. I, SS 20 if it is grossly out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense or nothing more than a purposeless and needless infliction of pain and suffering. State v. Smith, 2001-2574 (La. 1/14/03), 839 So. 2d 1; State v. Bonanno, 384 So. 2d 355 (La. 1980). A sentence is considered grossly disproportionate if, when the crime and punishment are viewed in light of the harm done to society, it shocks the sense of justice. State v. Weaver, 2001-0467 (La. 1/15/02), 805 So. 2d 166; State v. Robinson, 40,983 (La. App. 2d Cir. 1/24/07), 948 So. 2d 379. A trial court has broad discretion to sentence within the statutory limits. State v. Dunn, 30,767 (La. App. 2d Cir. 6/24/98), 715 So. 2d 641; State v. Guzman, 99-1528, 991753 (La. 5/16/00), 769 So. 2d 1158. Absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion, the appellate court may not set aside a sentence as excessive. Id. 3   Defendant    s exposure was from 10 to 30 years with or without hard labor. This midrange sentence of 25 years at hard labor is neither disproportionate, nor is it shocking to the sense of justice. Considering this man    s horrific record, the trial court certainly did not abuse its discretion. We note two errors patent in this record. We decline to take action on either.6 DECREE The defendant    s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. 6  Pursuant to La. R.S. 14:98(E)(1)(a), as it read on the date of the crime, 75 days of the sentence was required to have been imposed without benefits. In this case, the court failed to do so. The mandatory     without benefits     portion of the sentence will automatically be required. La. R.S. 15:301.1(A); see State v. Williams, 2000-1725 (La. 11/28/01), 800 So. 2d 790. Also, the trial court did not impose the statutorily mandated $5,000 fine, resulting in Rockett    s sentence actually being illegally lenient. We could correct the sentence, but we are not required to do so. State v. Griffin, 41,946 (La. App. 2d Cir. 5/2/07), 956 So. 2d 199. The state has not objected to the error and Rockett is certainly not prejudiced in any way by the trial court    s failure to impose a fine. 4</p> <p>Subscribe to Justia's Free Newsletters featuring summaries of federal and state court opinions.</p> <p>Subscribe Now</p>","Yes"

This is made difficult by the fact that they are not alone in ""Murder World"" -- a violent gang of evil clowns are there and stalking their every move.</p> <p>Captain Spaulding's Clown School In 3D and The Devil's Rejects debuted at Great American Nightmare in Scottsdale, Arizona last year. 31 is a brand new, never-before-seen haunt based on Rob's forthcoming film of the same name.</p> <p>The fully immersive haunted house experience at Rob Zombie's Great American Nightmare includes the all-new Bloody Boulevard with major carnival rides, freak shows, musical entertainment, roaming characters, themed food and beverages, games and vendors each night.</p> <p>Rob Zombie's Great American Nightmare will celebrate the Halloween season on the following dates before November 1:</p> <p>Hours for Rob Zombie's Great American Nightmare are 7:00 p.m. until midnight (Fridays and Saturdays) and 7:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. (Thursdays and Sundays).</p> <p>Rob Zombie's Great American Nightmare is a creative collaboration between master of the macabre Rob Zombie and preeminent haunted house producer Steve Kopelman. The event is produced by Rob Zombie, Steve Kopelman and Andy Gould.</p> <p>Odeum Expo Center is located at 1033 North Villa Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois, just outside Chicago. It's easily accessible from downtown Chicago by major highways, and from the Tri-State area by tollways.</p>","Yes"

every grim and secret fear I have about the human race is manifest in Robert Ben Rhoades."", ""Rhoades was a sexual sadist."", ""He kidnapped women, tortured and raped them for weeks before killing them."", ""What is known about him in the 1980s is murky."", ""He was involved in the BDSM and swinger scene in his hometown of Houston."", ""He was married."", ""When he was caught, he said that he had been \""doing this\"" for fifteen years, which would put the onset of his murders back into the 1970s."", ""His trucking logs place him in the area of fifty unsolved murders in the three years prior to his arrest alone."", ""While not all fifty cases have been tied to Rhoades yet and Rhoades himself has admitted to only three murders, the FBI has strong reason to believe that at his peak he was killing one to three women a month.Rhoades was first arrested when an Arizona state trooper found a screaming woman named Lisa Pennal* chained in the back of his cab."", ""He was charged with kidnapping and assault."", ""What put him away for life, though, was the rape and murder of Regina Walters, a 14-year-old girl from Pasadena, Texas."", ""Rhoades picked her up along with her boyfriend, Ricky Jones, in February of 1990."", ""Jones was promptly killed, and his remains were discovered later in Mississippi."", ""Rhoades kept Regina for at least two weeks."", ""He shaved her head and pubic hair, pierced her with fishing hooks, dressed her up in a black dress and heels, and photographed her in moments of terror, then killed her with a garrote made of baling wire, leaving her one-hundred-pound body to decompose in a barn in Illinois off Interstate 70.Behind the tragic elements of Regina's story, like some kind of pentimento, I saw my own."", ""Like me, she left home with her older boyfriend."", ""Also like me, Regina became dependent upon the grace of truck drivers."", ""In her weeks with Rhoades, many drivers saw her, but somehow no alarm was raised."", ""She passed through that world as if she were invisible.In 1985 my biggest problem was sleep."", ""There was no safe way for me to get it."", ""I left home in early January, hitchhiking south from New York City with my 21-year-old boyfriend."", ""We had $60 and a Smith Wesson five-shot with one bullet in it, which we accidentally fired off in a field in Maryland during a discussion about whether the safety was on."", ""I had a guitar and a knapsack full of souvenirs of my girlhood: notes from friends, earrings, and song lyrics."", ""I was 15.People don't leave home because things are going well; they leave because they feel they have to, and right or wrong, that's how I felt."", ""I lived with my mom in New York, and the fights between us were growing in intensity and emotional violence."", ""I don't think either of us knew what to do about it."", ""There was talk of me going to live with my dad in Virginia, where I had traditionally spent my summers."", ""By then, though, I had been kicked out of two schools for absences and was cutting myself regularly."", ""My emotions were a planet around which I spun like a moon."", ""As I saw it, it didn't matter if I left, because in so many ways I was already gone."", ""On my way out, I destroyed every single picture of me over the age of 12 so that there would be nothing to give to the police.That first night, my boyfriend and I stayed in an abandoned barn in Maryland."", ""It was off the side of the freeway and probably very much like the one Regina Walters was found in."", ""The barn had a loft with wind coming through broken slats and was surrounded by the same kind of brown grassy field and frozen mud."", ""Like Regina, I also had a little journal and probably wrote something in it that night, because it was far too cold to sleep."", ""We were back on the road before dawn, walking down a highway covered in black ice, shivering in our hoodies."", ""A trucker picked us up at daybreak, and I rode in a semi for the first time.Being up high, warm, and looking out over the traffic was a great improvement."", ""The trucker bought us chicken-fried steak, chatted amiably, and let us nap in the cab while he drove."", ""While we were asleep, he pulled into a small truck stop, and I woke to his hand down my shirt."", ""I kept my eyes closed, stayed still, then rolled away from him, pretending I was still asleep."", ""A few minutes later, I got up like nothing had happened."", ""The trucker went to pay for gas, and my boyfriend and I went to use the bathroom."", ""When we came back, the truck was gone and every reminder of home with it--my guitar, my knapsack, everything except the Smith Wesson, which we sold later in New Orleans."", ""*Some of the victims' names have been changed.""], [""That first ride was a preview of how it would often go for me with truckers--dodging sex and getting stranded--but I had learned one crucial lesson: When a truck slows down, you get up."", ""Getting sleep was pretty easy with a boyfriend, because one of us could always stay awake."", ""Six weeks later, though, we parted ways."", ""Somewhere in Arizona we had a fight in a gas station off I-10, and we each climbed into separate trucks, and that was it."", ""I was on my own."", ""Without fake ID, I couldn't stay in a shelter."", ""Sleeping by myself on the street made me a target, and having sex with some creepy old guy for a spot on a mattress also held little appeal."", ""So I went back to hitchhiking in circles and discovered a state of half-consciousness wherein I could be asleep and not asleep at the same time."", ""I could rest but not dream."", ""I could tell you the last three songs played on the radio if you asked, but only if you asked."", ""If you didn't, I had no memory of them at all.I stuck to trucks because they were safer than cars."", ""When you get in a truck at a truck stop, everyone notices."", ""They chatter about it on the CB, and you are driving off in what amounts to a huge billboard advertising the name of the company."", ""I needed visibility to stay alive."", ""But it was also a dangerous form of brinksmanship, because if a trucker was going to cross the line, the higher stakes meant he was going to do it for real."", ""There was a gap before that line, and most truckers wouldn't take it that far."", ""I lived in that gap.Truck stops in the 1980s were closed worlds where what went on passed unnoticed on the outside."", ""The stores were dimly lit and filled with smoke, radically different from the family travel plazas of today."", ""Magazine porn often dominated the aisles--glossies like Hustler and Barely Legal but also newsprint rags with cheap color covers."", ""Bottles of isobutyl nitrite and rotgut aphrodisiacs like Locker Room and Spanish Fly crowded the counters by the register, along with the iconic bumper sticker ASS, GAS, OR GRASS--NO ONE RIDES FOR FREE.Back then, though, my thoughts weren't on misogyny; they were on logistics."", ""I needed to find rides and usually couldn't get into the restaurant."", ""The general rule was that you were a prostitute until proven otherwise."", ""And then you were still a prostitute."", ""Waitresses were the first to kick you out."", ""That forced me into asking for rides in the hallway by the showers."", ""Over time, I learned safer ways of getting rides by having truckers navigate the CB radio for me."", ""Women couldn't really get on the \""zoo channel,\"" as they called it then, because the sound of their voice would trigger twenty minutes of crass chatter."", ""There was only one word for woman on the CB, and that was beaver."", ""Even the guys who were trying to help had used it."", ""They had to make up stories for me: \""I got a beaver needs a ride to Flagstaff for her grandma's funeral don't want no trouble, c'mon back.\"""", ""There was always a sick mom or dead grandparent involved, and I was almost always abandoned by my jerk of a boyfriend, who'd made off with all my money and my car.Through these stories, I jumped from truck to truck."", ""Like a lemur in a canopy of trees, I barely saw the ground."", ""Even so, it still wasn't safe to sleep."", ""Adhering to my rule (that the only safe truck was a moving truck) meant I woke when a truck took an exit."", ""I woke when it slowed for traffic."", ""When it turned, when it downshifted, when it drifted toward the shoulder--I woke."", ""Wearing down from lack of sleep and trying to get a handle on my risk level, I began to work off a 1-to-5 scale of sexually aggressive behavior:""], [""You (the driver) kept your urges to yourself.""], [""You asked me to have sex and offered to pay.""], [""You told me I owed you sex for the ride and chicken-fried steak and threatened to drop me off somewhere dangerous.""], [""You dropped me off somewhere dangerous.""], [""I had to jump when you slowed down because you were going to rape me.""], [""Most truckers occupied the middle of the scale, but the trucker who resembled Rhoades didn't have a place on it."", ""Anybody who pulls a knife on you in an enclosed space like a truck is terrifying."", ""But beyond that, it was the man's demeanor that was so chilling."", ""He wasn't nervous, angry, or excited."", ""He was grave and methodical as if preparing to dress a deer.From reading about Rhoades, I knew that he preferred hitchhikers to prostitutes and specifically targeted runaways."", ""I also knew the first thing he did was to get them into the back of his sleeper cab, which had anchor points for shackles."", ""But I hadn't seen any shackles."", ""I only saw the man with the knife."", ""\""It has to be him,\"" a friend said."", ""\""How many of those guys could there be?"", ""\""According to the FBI, quite a few."", ""In 2009 the feds went public with a program called the Highway Serial Killings Initiative in response to a rising number of dead bodies found along the interstates."", ""Some of these were women left in Dumpsters."", ""Narrowing the field to those last seen around truck stops and rest areas, the bureau counted over 500 bodies, almost all women."", ""Of the 200 people on a suspect list, almost all of them were long-haul truckers.But nobody had to tell me that people like Rhoades killed people like me and got away with it."", ""Going through the truck stops, I'd heard about women getting their throats slit or strangled."", ""I'd heard of at least one who got hung up on a meat hook in the back of a refrigerated trailer because a trucker thought she'd given him VD."", ""At night I listened to the voices of prostitutes on the CB, barely intelligible between streams of name-calling: \""Hello, honey."", ""It's me, Sugar Bear, in party row."", ""Anyone want to party?"", ""\""\""Lot lizards\"" is what truckers call prostitutes who work truck stops, and since many drivers don't distinguish between hitchhikers and prostitutes, I was a lot lizard, too."", ""If we went missing, months could pass before a report was filed, and by then there was little to connect the missing person in one state with the decomposed remains in another."", ""When the Illinois state trooper who was trying to identify the body of Regina Walters, the girl Rhoades left in that barn, put her forensic description out on the national teletype, he was totally unprepared for the response."", ""He requested information on missing Caucasian females aged 13 to 15 years old who had disappeared six to nine months earlier."", ""He got over 900 matches.If there was any way to connect my story to Rhoades, it would be through the body of the girl in the Dumpster."", ""Records on her would provide a date and a place that could then be checked against Rhoades's trucking logs."", ""To at least one of my questions--was Rhoades my guy?--I'd have a clear answer, a simple yes or no.I began by Googling things like \""dead girl truck stop Martinsburg.\"""", ""Nothing came up, but that wasn't too surprising."", ""Her murder happened twenty-seven years ago and was essentially pre-Internet."", ""I pulled up a map of Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, and that's where things started to get hazy."", ""Martinsburg was nothing but a pinprick, just a dot on a minor route feeding into a midsize highway on the outskirts of Altoona, PA, not the sort of place you'd expect to find a busy truck stop."", ""Had I confused the state?"", ""I did a search on towns named Martinsburg."", ""There were seven within range--Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, West Virginia, and New York--all less than a day's drive apart.A week before the girl was found in the Dumpster, though, I'd gone to see my dad in Virginia."", ""At the time, he was struggling himself, living with several other guys in a house where you flushed the toilet with a bucket of water and working what little construction there was in the county."", ""I quickly realized I would have been nothing but a burden."", ""The morning I left, I asked him to take me to the closest truck stop so I could get a ride going toward California."", ""It was a made-up destination, a Grapes of Wrath narrative of brighter futures."", ""I was sure he would remember where he took me back then, so last spring I called him."", ""I didn't tell him about my recent inquiries at first; I just asked where he'd dropped me off."", ""Without any hesitation he said Martinsburg, West Virginia."", ""\""Were there any murders that summer?\"""", ""I asked him."", ""\""There was that hitchhiker."", ""You called and left a message a day or so after I dropped you off, saying I was going to read about a dead 17-year-old hitchhiker they found in a truck stop and that it wasn't you."", ""\""My whole body relaxed."", ""My memory may have been bent by sleep deprivation, but I was not crazy."", ""There was a Martinsburg truck stop somewhere in my story, and there was a dead 17-year-old hitchhiker."", ""She had existed enough for me to call my dad all those years ago and warn him about what he would read."", ""And if it happened, she could be found."", ""It was just a matter of looking harder.The original Rhoades investigation had woven a complex web, entangling local and federal agencies in five different states."", ""Eventually the locus shifted to the Houston FBI, because at some point every thread ran through Texas."", ""Rhoades was from Texas."", ""His wife, Debra Davis, was from Texas."", ""Regina Walters and Ricky Jones were from Texas."", ""He picked up two of his other victims in Texas.I flew to Austin to meet with two retired FBI men, special agents Mark Young and Robert F. Lee, who'd both worked on the case."", ""Young was a profiler for the bureau as well as a field agent."", ""Over lunch at a local sushi place, he taught me the difference between a mode of operation and a signature."", ""Modes of operation change."", ""They are more like habits, he said, and can adapt to circumstances or mood."", ""Rhoades, for instance, used guns and ligature strangulation and probably knives, too."", ""A signature, however, does not change."", ""Sexual sadists in particular work off erotic maps established early on."", ""They get more nuanced and elaborate, but the basic topography remains the same."", ""One of Rhoades's signatures was shaving the head and pubic hair of his female victims."", ""Piercings around the breasts, bruising, and other signs of torture were also frequently found.Young, a six-foot-four Texan and third-generation lawman, opened his laptop and pulled up a picture of a woman named Shana Holts."", ""* Only days before Regina Walters was taken, Rhoades had been detained by the police in Houston for the possible sexual assault and kidnapping of Holts."", ""She'd been picked up in a truck stop, shackled into the back of the cab, tortured and raped for weeks."", ""She'd escaped when Rhoades pulled into a Houston brewery."", ""I'd always read that she got away because Rhoades forgot to chain her in, but I found out from Young that she'd not been shackled when she escaped."", ""Rhoades had told her to \""sit there and be a good girl.\"""", ""But Holts, 18 years old, had been on the street since she was 12."", ""By her own account, she had been raped at least twenty times and had already had a baby."", ""She knew how to survive."", ""Whatever the man thought he had broken in her had already been broken and healed back stronger."", ""She didn't do what he expected."", ""She ran."", ""She brought the police right back to Rhoades's truck but then balked at pressing charges, so they had to let him go."", ""The story was that she was too scared, but I wondered if there was more.I looked at the picture on Young's computer."", ""Shana was a pretty girl with freckles and blank blue eyes."", ""Her thick red-blond hair had been cropped close to her head with a knife or scissors and was now growing back."", ""With all her freckles, she looked very Irish."", ""Around her neck was a dog chain with a padlock attached to the ring that had been used to restrain her neck."", ""But in the picture, with her inch-long hair and dog collar, she looked like a gutter punk, like any girl you might see in any university district.Young then showed me some photos of Rhoades in the 1980s that had come from his wife."", ""In one, he relaxed on the grass in a park."", ""The natural light brought his hair closer to the color I remembered, and, again, the side view heightened the key similarities, his cheekbone shape, glasses, the expression; but as I had learned from the echo chamber of Martinsburgs, memory is strange territory."", ""By now papers and photographs were spread out all over the table, and Young was waiting for me to tell my story."", ""Although I'd told it more in the preceding week than in the past two decades, I still wasn't used to doing it, and the nausea still came."", ""\""One thing I always did,\"" I told Young, \""was rifle through a trucker's cassette case as soon as we were out on the highway.\"""", ""This gave me a screen behind which to observe drivers when they thought I was distracted."", ""It allowed me to pretend not to hear scary red-flag comments so I could act dumb and get away later, and this is what I was doing that day, going through a tape case, chatting like an idiot and watching the driver--which is why I saw him change."", ""I told Young about the Laughing Death Society."", ""He'd never heard the phrase."", ""I asked about the knife."", ""Every trucker I ever met had a gun, so the knife seemed significant."", ""He said a gun was about control but a knife is personal."", ""I'd seen the page from Regina's little notebook on which Rhoades had drawn a picture of a gun and a huge dagger dripping blood next to the words RICKY IS A DEAD MAN."", ""\""So was the trucker I met a true psychopath?\"""", ""I asked."", ""\""What I find interesting is that he told you about the body of the girl and talked about the Laughing Death Society while he was still driving."", ""You were not under his control."", ""This tells me that he liked manipulating through terror."", ""That it turned him on, just like Rhoades."", ""\""\""But a real serial killer wouldn't have let me go, right?\"""", ""I asked."", ""\""Maybe he didn't think you'd run."", ""\""Even at the time, I'd wondered if my running was part of the game."", ""Rhoades was a great lover of games."", ""His favorite book was Games People Play, wherein each social encounter is treated as a transaction or \""game.\"""", ""One game in the book is called \""Courtroom.\"""", ""Another is called \""Beat Me Daddy,\"" another \""Frigid Woman.\"""", ""In that one, driven by penis envy, a woman's inner child taunts a man into seducing her so that she can be freed from guilt for her own \""sadistic fantasies.\"""", ""Games People Play was a bible for Rhoades."", ""He talked about it frequently and applied its ideas."", ""In a letter to his wife on the subject of psychological games, he wrote: \""I always told you there were three things you could do: play, pass, or run.\"""", ""The phrase \""play, pass, run\"" is used twice in the letter."", ""Reading it, I found it hard not to hear the man telling me to \""run."", ""\""The more I learned about Rhoades, the more I saw parallels between us."", ""While I was hitchhiking, he was driving."", ""And while I was getting more adept at survival, he was getting more adept at killing.""], [""On the table in front of Young was a snapshot of Regina Walters that I hadn't seen, taken not very long before she was abducted."", ""In it, she's sitting in the backseat of a car."", ""The sun is coming down on her long hair, and she's laughing."", ""She looks like any other skinny kid just out of middle school."", ""She looks happy."", ""The picture was given to Young by Regina's mom."", ""Initially, agents had disagreed over whether the young girl on Rhoades's film was Regina."", ""It was agent Young who recognized the small gap in Regina's teeth and noticed that a few freckles were in the same place.Young pulled out one last picture and slid it across to me."", ""The photo was of a beautiful young girl, possibly Native American."", ""\""She was on the end of the roll with Regina,\"" he said."", ""She's shown sitting in Rhoades's truck wearing a gray hoodie."", ""Her eyes are partly closed, as if she's stoned or sleepy."", ""Rhoades must have just picked her up, because he hasn't cut her hair yet."", ""It is glossy black and long.No one knows who she is.On the phone, agent Robert F.

moment."", ""I had not told him or anyone else how I felt about failing to go to the cops."", ""These were my private feelings."", ""The idea that I might have been responsible for what happened to girls like Regina was devastating, and Lee's directness startled me."", ""It was a raw moment."", ""So I told him the truth, which I had not told others--that I didn't say anything because I didn't think anyone would believe me."", ""\""Well,\"" said Lee, sitting back after I finished, \""you're probably right."", ""Look at Lisa Pennal."", ""\""Pennal was the woman chained into Rhoades's truck

whispering those same words.The more I learned about Rhoades, the more I saw parallels between us."", ""It wasn't lost on me that while I was hitchhiking and he was driving, we would both have struggled with some of the same challenges--sleep deprivation and the hypnotic dullness of going through identical locations over and over, a world constructed of boredom and violence."", ""And while I was getting more adept at survival, he was very likely getting more adept at killing."", ""We both had our own systems, our own rituals, and our own beliefs about what people were really like and

floats around the Internet."", ""It's actually from a Halloween party in Houston where he went as a \""slave,\"" led on a chain by his wife, who was dressed as a dominatrix.Debra Davis and Rhoades met

Will be used in accordance with our Privacy PolicySubscribeGet Even More GQ This MonthLet's do itHe was methodical, he rode the highways, and he preyed on teenage girls. Girls who'd run away. Girls no one would miss. In the summer of 1985, the author was such a girl. One night on I-95, she hitched a ride from a stranger and endured the most terrifying moments of her life. Now, years later, she returns to the scenes of her fugitive youth looking for clues to that terror--and the girls who lost their lives to itIn the summer of 1985, somewhere near Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, the body of a young woman was pulled from a truck-stop Dumpster. I had just hitched a ride and was sitting in a nearby truck waiting for the driver to pay for gas so we could leave. When they found her, there was shouting. A man from the restaurant ran out and started yelling for everyone to stay away as a small crowd gathered around the Dumpster in the rain. Word filtered back that the dead girl was a teenage hitchhiker. I remember thinking it could be me, since I was also a teenage hitchhiker. Watching the driver of my truck walk back across the wet asphalt, a second thought arose: It could be him. He could be the killer. The driver reached the cab, swung up behind the wheel, and said we should get going. He said he didn't want to get caught up in anything time-consuming. Stowing his paperwork, he released the brake. Neither of us said anything about the dead girl. As we pulled away, I looked once more in the side mirror. They were stringing crime tape around the Dumpster just as another state trooper rolled into the lot.</p> <p>That ride turned out to be fine. We drove up to Ohio drinking Diet Coke and listening to Bruce Springsteen. The trucker bought me lunch and didn't even try to have sex with me, which made him a prince in my world. Several days later, though, heading south on I-95 through the Carolinas, I got picked up by another trucker who was not fine. I don't remember much about him except that he was taller and leaner than most truckers and didn't wear jeans or T-shirts. He wore a cotton button-down with the sleeves rolled neatly up over his biceps and had the cleanest cab I ever saw. He must have seemed okay or I wouldn't have gotten in the truck with him. Once out on the road, though, he changed. He stopped responding to my questions. His bearing shifted. He grew taller in his seat, and his face muscles relaxed into something both arrogant and blank. Then he started talking about the dead girl in the Dumpster and asked me if I'd ever heard of the Laughing Death Society. ""We laugh at death,"" he told me.A few minutes later, he pulled the truck onto the shoulder of the road by some woods, took out a hunting knife, and told me to get into the back of the cab. I began talking, saying the same things over and over. I said I knew he didn't want to do it. I said it was his choice. I said he could do it in a few minutes. I said it was his choice. I said I wouldn't go to the cops if nothing happened to me, but it was his choice--until he looked at me and I went still. There was going to be no more talking. I knew in my body that it was over. Then he said one word: Run. Without looking back, I ran into the woods and hid. I stayed there until I saw the truck pull onto the interstate. It was getting dark. I was still in shock, so I walked back out to the same road and started hitching south. I never went to the police and didn't tell anyone for years.This spring a friend sent a news story link about a serial killer with the subject line ""Is this your guy?"" The serial killer's name was Robert Ben Rhoades. Rhoades was a long-haul trucker, in jail since 1990, who had recently been convicted of a couple of new ""cold cases."" I didn't recognize him from the initial photos, but as I found pictures of him as a younger man, his face came to seem more familiar. The glasses were the same, the curve of the cheekbone, and something about the expression, particularly the set of the mouth. It had the same neutral arrogance. Rhoades looked like the guy who picked me up. But then, Rhoades looks like a lot of guys. He would only have been 39 at the time, and I remember the trucker as an older man with light brown or graying hair. To a teenager, though, someone pushing 40 is pretty old, and hair often looks darker in photos. The light in my memory is strange, too. It was a cloudy day just before a summer storm, and everything in the truck is cast in gray.After receiving my friend's e-mail, I left messages with the FBI but was relieved when they were not returned. The memory was twenty-seven years old, and nothing in it was actionable. The photos stayed in my head, though, and with them came questions: What if the man who pulled the knife on me really did murder the hitchhiker? Why did he let me go? Who was the girl in the Dumpster? Why didn't I go to anyone? I needed to understand what my responsibility was and to find my own answers, if nobody else's, so I began to look.I have no fascination with serial killers, so I didn't realize that Rhoades was famous. There are articles, TV episodes, and books on him--Driven to Kill, Roadside Prey, Killer on the Road--and from these sources I learned that every grim and secret fear I have about the human race is manifest in Robert Ben Rhoades. Rhoades was a sexual sadist. He kidnapped women, tortured and raped them for weeks before killing them. What is known about him in the 1980s is murky. He was involved in the BDSM and swinger scene in his hometown of Houston. He was married. When he was caught, he said that he had been ""doing this"" for fifteen years, which would put the onset of his murders back into the 1970s. His trucking logs place him in the area of fifty unsolved murders in the three years prior to his arrest alone. While not all fifty cases have been tied to Rhoades yet and Rhoades himself has admitted to only three murders, the FBI has strong reason to believe that at his peak he was killing one to three women a month.Rhoades was first arrested when an Arizona state trooper found a screaming woman named Lisa Pennal* chained in the back of his cab. He was charged with kidnapping and assault. What put him away for life, though, was the rape and murder of Regina Walters, a 14-year-old girl from Pasadena, Texas. Rhoades picked her up along with her boyfriend, Ricky Jones, in February of 1990. Jones was promptly killed, and his remains were discovered later in Mississippi. Rhoades kept Regina for at least two weeks. He shaved her head and pubic hair, pierced her with fishing hooks, dressed her up in a black dress and heels, and photographed her in moments of terror, then killed her with a garrote made of baling wire, leaving her one-hundred-pound body to decompose in a barn in Illinois off Interstate 70.Behind the tragic elements of Regina's story, like some kind of pentimento, I saw my own. Like me, she left home with her older boyfriend. Also like me, Regina became dependent upon the grace of truck drivers. In her weeks with Rhoades, many drivers saw her, but somehow no alarm was raised. She passed through that world as if she were invisible.In 1985 my biggest problem was sleep. There was no safe way for me to get it. I left home in early January, hitchhiking south from New York City with my 21-year-old boyfriend. We had $60 and a Smith Wesson five-shot with one bullet in it, which we accidentally fired off in a field in Maryland during a discussion about whether the safety was on. I had a guitar and a knapsack full of souvenirs of my girlhood: notes from friends, earrings, and song lyrics. I was 15.People don't leave home because things are going well; they leave because they feel they have to, and right or wrong, that's how I felt. I lived with my mom in New York, and the fights between us were growing in intensity and emotional violence. I don't think either of us knew what to do about it. There was talk of me going to live with my dad in Virginia, where I had traditionally spent my summers. By then, though, I had been kicked out of two schools for absences and was cutting myself regularly. My emotions were a planet around which I spun like a moon. As I saw it, it didn't matter if I left, because in so many ways I was already gone. On my way out, I destroyed every single picture of me over the age of 12 so that there would be nothing to give to the police.That first night, my boyfriend and I stayed in an abandoned barn in Maryland. It was off the side of the freeway and probably very much like the one Regina Walters was found in. The barn had a loft with wind coming through broken slats and was surrounded by the same kind of brown grassy field and frozen mud. Like Regina, I also had a little journal and probably wrote something in it that night, because it was far too cold to sleep. We were back on the road before dawn, walking down a highway covered in black ice, shivering in our hoodies. A trucker picked us up at daybreak, and I rode in a semi for the first time.Being up high, warm, and looking out over the traffic was a great improvement. The trucker bought us chicken-fried steak, chatted amiably, and let us nap in the cab while he drove. While we were asleep, he pulled into a small truck stop, and I woke to his hand down my shirt. I kept my eyes closed, stayed still, then rolled away from him, pretending I was still asleep. A few minutes later, I got up like nothing had happened. The trucker went to pay for gas, and my boyfriend and I went to use the bathroom. When we came back, the truck was gone and every reminder of home with it--my guitar, my knapsack, everything except the Smith Wesson, which we sold later in New Orleans. *Some of the victims' names have been changed.</p> <p>That first ride was a preview of how it would often go for me with truckers--dodging sex and getting stranded--but I had learned one crucial lesson: When a truck slows down, you get up. Getting sleep was pretty easy with a boyfriend, because one of us could always stay awake. Six weeks later, though, we parted ways. Somewhere in Arizona we had a fight in a gas station off I-10, and we each climbed into separate trucks, and that was it. I was on my own. Without fake ID, I couldn't stay in a shelter. Sleeping by myself on the street made me a target, and having sex with some creepy old guy for a spot on a mattress also held little appeal. So I went back to hitchhiking in circles and discovered a state of half-consciousness wherein I could be asleep and not asleep at the same time. I could rest but not dream. I could tell you the last three songs played on the radio if you asked, but only if you asked. If you didn't, I had no memory of them at all.I stuck to trucks because they were safer than cars. When you get in a truck at a truck stop, everyone notices. They chatter about it on the CB, and you are driving off in what amounts to a huge billboard advertising the name of the company. I needed visibility to stay alive. But it was also a dangerous form of brinksmanship, because if a trucker was going to cross the line, the higher stakes meant he was going to do it for real. There was a gap before that line, and most truckers wouldn't take it that far. I lived in that gap.Truck stops in the 1980s were closed worlds where what went on passed unnoticed on the outside. The stores were dimly lit and filled with smoke, radically different from the family travel plazas of today. Magazine porn often dominated the aisles--glossies like Hustler and Barely Legal but also newsprint rags with cheap color covers. Bottles of isobutyl nitrite and rotgut aphrodisiacs like Locker Room and Spanish Fly crowded the counters by the register, along with the iconic bumper sticker ASS, GAS, OR GRASS--NO ONE RIDES FOR FREE.Back then, though, my thoughts weren't on misogyny; they were on logistics. I needed to find rides and usually couldn't get into the restaurant. The general rule was that you were a prostitute until proven otherwise. And then you were still a prostitute. Waitresses were the first to kick you out. That forced me into asking for rides in the hallway by the showers. Over time, I learned safer ways of getting rides by having truckers navigate the CB radio for me. Women couldn't really get on the ""zoo channel,"" as they called it then, because the sound of their voice would trigger twenty minutes of crass chatter. There was only one word for woman on the CB, and that was beaver. Even the guys who were trying to help had used it. They had to make up stories for me: ""I got a beaver needs a ride to Flagstaff for her grandma's funeral don't want no trouble, c'mon back."" There was always a sick mom or dead grandparent involved, and I was almost always abandoned by my jerk of a boyfriend, who'd made off with all my money and my car.Through these stories, I jumped from truck to truck. Like a lemur in a canopy of trees, I barely saw the ground. Even so, it still wasn't safe to sleep. Adhering to my rule (that the only safe truck was a moving truck) meant I woke when a truck took an exit. I woke when it slowed for traffic. When it turned, when it downshifted, when it drifted toward the shoulder--I woke. Wearing down from lack of sleep and trying to get a handle on my risk level, I began to work off a 1-to-5 scale of sexually aggressive behavior:</p> <p>You (the driver) kept your urges to yourself.</p> <p>You asked me to have sex and offered to pay.</p> <p>You told me I owed you sex for the ride and chicken-fried steak and threatened to drop me off somewhere dangerous.</p> <p>You dropped me off somewhere dangerous.</p> <p>I had to jump when you slowed down because you were going to rape me.</p> <p>Most truckers occupied the middle of the scale, but the trucker who resembled Rhoades didn't have a place on it. Anybody who pulls a knife on you in an enclosed space like a truck is terrifying. But beyond that, it was the man's demeanor that was so chilling. He wasn't nervous, angry, or excited. He was grave and methodical as if preparing to dress a deer.From reading about Rhoades, I knew that he preferred hitchhikers to prostitutes and specifically targeted runaways. I also knew the first thing he did was to get them into the back of his sleeper cab, which had anchor points for shackles. But I hadn't seen any shackles. I only saw the man with the knife. ""It has to be him,"" a friend said. ""How many of those guys could there be? ""According to the FBI, quite a few. In 2009 the feds went public with a program called the Highway Serial Killings Initiative in response to a rising number of dead bodies found along the interstates. Some of these were women left in Dumpsters. Narrowing the field to those last seen around truck stops and rest areas, the bureau counted over 500 bodies, almost all women. Of the 200 people on a suspect list, almost all of them were long-haul truckers.But nobody had to tell me that people like Rhoades killed people like me and got away with it. Going through the truck stops, I'd heard about women getting their throats slit or strangled. I'd heard of at least one who got hung up on a meat hook in the back of a refrigerated trailer because a trucker thought she'd given him VD. At night I listened to the voices of prostitutes on the CB, barely intelligible between streams of name-calling: ""Hello, honey. It's me, Sugar Bear, in party row. Anyone want to party? """"Lot lizards"" is what truckers call prostitutes who work truck stops, and since many drivers don't distinguish between hitchhikers and prostitutes, I was a lot lizard, too. If we went missing, months could pass before a report was filed, and by then there was little to connect the missing person in one state with the decomposed remains in another. When the Illinois state trooper who was trying to identify the body of Regina Walters, the girl Rhoades left in that barn, put her forensic description out on the national teletype, he was totally unprepared for the response. He requested information on missing Caucasian females aged 13 to 15 years old who had disappeared six to nine months earlier. He got over 900 matches.If there was any way to connect my story to Rhoades, it would be through the body of the girl in the Dumpster. Records on her would provide a date and a place that could then be checked against Rhoades's trucking logs. To at least one of my questions--was Rhoades my guy?--I'd have a clear answer, a simple yes or no.I began by Googling things like ""dead girl truck stop Martinsburg."" Nothing came up, but that wasn't too surprising. Her murder happened twenty-seven years ago and was essentially pre-Internet. I pulled up a map of Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, and that's where things started to get hazy. Martinsburg was nothing but a pinprick, just a dot on a minor route feeding into a midsize highway on the outskirts of Altoona, PA, not the sort of place you'd expect to find a busy truck stop. Had I confused the state? I did a search on towns named Martinsburg. There were seven within range--Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, West Virginia, and New York--all less than a day's drive apart.A week before the girl was found in the Dumpster, though, I'd gone to see my dad in Virginia. At the time, he was struggling himself, living with several other guys in a house where you flushed the toilet with a bucket of water and working what little construction there was in the county. I quickly realized I would have been nothing but a burden. The morning I left, I asked him to take me to the closest truck stop so I could get a ride going toward California. It was a made-up destination, a Grapes of Wrath narrative of brighter futures. I was sure he would remember where he took me back then, so last spring I called him. I didn't tell him about my recent inquiries at first; I just asked where he'd dropped me off. Without any hesitation he said Martinsburg, West Virginia. ""Were there any murders that summer?"" I asked him. ""There was that hitchhiker. You called and left a message a day or so after I dropped you off, saying I was going to read about a dead 17-year-old hitchhiker they found in a truck stop and that it wasn't you. ""My whole body relaxed. My memory may have been bent by sleep deprivation, but I was not crazy. There was a Martinsburg truck stop somewhere in my story, and there was a dead 17-year-old hitchhiker. She had existed enough for me to call my dad all those years ago and warn him about what he would read. And if it happened, she could be found. It was just a matter of looking harder.The original Rhoades investigation had woven a complex web, entangling local and federal agencies in five different states. Eventually the locus shifted to the Houston FBI, because at some point every thread ran through Texas. Rhoades was from Texas. His wife, Debra Davis, was from Texas. Regina Walters and Ricky Jones were from Texas. He picked up two of his other victims in Texas.I flew to Austin to meet with two retired FBI men, special agents Mark Young and Robert F. Lee, who'd both worked on the case. Young was a profiler for the bureau as well as a field agent. Over lunch at a local sushi place, he taught me the difference between a mode of operation and a signature. Modes of operation change. They are more like habits, he said, and can adapt to circumstances or mood. Rhoades, for instance, used guns and ligature strangulation and probably knives, too. A signature, however, does not change. Sexual sadists in particular work off erotic maps established early on. They get more nuanced and elaborate, but the basic topography remains the same. One of Rhoades's signatures was shaving the head and pubic hair of his female victims. Piercings around the breasts, bruising, and other signs of torture were also frequently found.Young, a six-foot-four Texan and third-generation lawman, opened his laptop and pulled up a picture of a woman named Shana Holts. * Only days before Regina Walters was taken, Rhoades had been detained by the police in Houston for the possible sexual assault and kidnapping of Holts. She'd been picked up in a truck stop, shackled into the back of the cab, tortured and raped for weeks. She'd escaped when Rhoades pulled into a Houston brewery. I'd always read that she got away because Rhoades forgot to chain her in, but I found out from Young that she'd not been shackled when she escaped. Rhoades had told her to ""sit there and be a good girl."" But Holts, 18 years old, had been on the street since she was 12. By her own account, she had been raped at least twenty times and had already had a baby. She knew how to survive. Whatever the man thought he had broken in her had already been broken and healed back stronger. She didn't do what he expected. She ran. She brought the police right back to Rhoades's truck but then balked at pressing charges, so they had to let him go. The story was that she was too scared, but I wondered if there was more.I looked at the picture on Young's computer. Shana was a pretty girl with freckles and blank blue eyes. Her thick red-blond hair had been cropped close to her head with a knife or scissors and was now growing back. With all her freckles, she looked very Irish. Around her neck was a dog chain with a padlock attached to the ring that had been used to restrain her neck. But in the picture, with her inch-long hair and dog collar, she looked like a gutter punk, like any girl you might see in any university district.Young then showed me some photos of Rhoades in the 1980s that had come from his wife. In one, he relaxed on the grass in a park. The natural light brought his hair closer to the color I remembered, and, again, the side view heightened the key similarities, his cheekbone shape, glasses, the expression; but as I had learned from the echo chamber of Martinsburgs, memory is strange territory. By now papers and photographs were spread out all over the table, and Young was waiting for me to tell my story. Although I'd told it more in the preceding week than in the past two decades, I still wasn't used to doing it, and the nausea still came. ""One thing I always did,"" I told Young, ""was rifle through a trucker's cassette case as soon as we were out on the highway."" This gave me a screen behind which to observe drivers when they thought I was distracted. It allowed me to pretend not to hear scary red-flag comments so I could act dumb and get away later, and this is what I was doing that day, going through a tape case, chatting like an idiot and watching the driver--which is why I saw him change. I told Young about the Laughing Death Society. He'd never heard the phrase. I asked about the knife. Every trucker I ever met had a gun, so the knife seemed significant. He said a gun was about control but a knife is personal. I'd seen the page from Regina's little notebook on which Rhoades had drawn a picture of a gun and a huge dagger dripping blood next to the words RICKY IS A DEAD MAN. ""So was the trucker I met a true psychopath?"" I asked. ""What I find interesting is that he told you about the body of the girl and talked about the Laughing Death Society while he was still driving. You were not under his control. This tells me that he liked manipulating through terror. That it turned him on, just like Rhoades. """"But a real serial killer wouldn't have let me go, right?"" I asked. ""Maybe he didn't think you'd run. ""Even at the time, I'd wondered if my running was part of the game. Rhoades was a great lover of games. His favorite book was Games People Play, wherein each social encounter is treated as a transaction or ""game."" One game in the book is called ""Courtroom."" Another is called ""Beat Me Daddy,"" another ""Frigid Woman."" In that one, driven by penis envy, a woman's inner child taunts a man into seducing her so that she can be freed from guilt for her own ""sadistic fantasies."" Games People Play was a bible for Rhoades. He talked about it frequently and applied its ideas. In a letter to his wife on the subject of psychological games, he wrote: ""I always told you there were three things you could do: play, pass, or run."" The phrase ""play, pass, run"" is used twice in the letter. Reading it, I found it hard not to hear the man telling me to ""run. ""The more I learned about Rhoades, the more I saw parallels between us. While I was hitchhiking, he was driving. And while I was getting more adept at survival, he was getting more adept at killing.</p> <p>On the table in front of Young was a snapshot of Regina Walters that I hadn't seen, taken not very long before she was abducted. In it, she's sitting in the backseat of a car. The sun is coming down on her long hair, and she's laughing. She looks like any other skinny kid just out of middle school. She looks happy. The picture was given to Young by Regina's mom. Initially, agents had disagreed over whether the young girl on Rhoades's film was Regina. It was agent Young who recognized the small gap in Regina's teeth and noticed that a few freckles were in the same place.Young pulled out one last picture and slid it across to me. The photo was of a beautiful young girl, possibly Native American. ""She was on the end of the roll with Regina,"" he said. She's shown sitting in Rhoades's truck wearing a gray hoodie. Her eyes are partly closed, as if she's stoned or sleepy. Rhoades must have just picked her up, because he hasn't cut her hair yet. It is glossy black and long.No one knows who she is.On the phone, agent Robert F. Lee was civil and to the point but not overtly warm. I arrived at his door melting in the hundred-degree heat. He welcomed me into his spacious living room. Tall and square-jawed, Lee looked like he could probably still tackle a bank robber. Behind him was a shoulder-high pink plastic castle.On the couch beside me was a large pillow with the FBI seal. ""That's from my old SWAT jacket."" He grinned. ""They don't use that emblem now. Looks too much like a target. ""The question of what you do with your old SWAT jacket when you retire had never entered my mind. Clearly the answer is: Make a throw pillow.I got the sense Lee appreciated brevity, so I dispensed with small talk and went straight to my questions, but he stopped me. ""I just want you to know,"" he said, looking me squarely in the eye, ""that what Rhoades did to women, he did to women. You didn't do it. ""Everything I expected from Bob Lee changed in that moment. I had not told him or anyone else how I felt about failing to go to the cops. These were my private feelings. The idea that I might have been responsible for what happened to girls like Regina was devastating, and Lee's directness startled me. It was a raw moment. So I told him the truth, which I had not told others--that I didn't say anything because I didn't think anyone would believe me. ""Well,"" said Lee, sitting back after I finished, ""you're probably right. Look at Lisa Pennal. ""Pennal was the woman chained into Rhoades's truck when they arrested him in Arizona. When rescued, she was wearing fuzzy lion slippers, talking secret prisons and being on a mission to see the president--just the kind of testimony that makes most detectives stop taking notes, since they're looking at someone who can't stand trial. Her statement was videotaped the night she was freed from Rhoades's truck. Lee still uses the tape when he trains police detectives in interrogation. He shows it and asks what they think is going on. Most say she's a prostitute and that it's a ""transaction gone bad."" Between Pennal and Rhoades, it's Rhoades they believe. ""Of course,"" Lee says, ""Lisa was talking all sorts of crazy stuff. Microchips in her brain. Holes in the ozone layer. She was wearing those slippers--but she was telling the truth. ""I had a vision of Lisa Pennal as a truck-stop Kali roaming the back lots in her denim skirt and fuzzy slippers with an ozone hole for a halo. She would be easy to dismiss. Rhoades intentionally chose women who lacked credibility. Sometimes, as with Shana Holts, the girl who had escaped in the brewery, the sense of not being credible was internalized. Lee told me that the final lines of Holts's police statement read, ""I don't see any good in filing charges. It's just going to be my word against his. If there was any evidence, I would file. I would file charges and sue him. ""It took me a second to understand those last sentences. What evidence was she lacking? She was found running naked, screaming down a street in Houston with DNA all over her body, her head and pubic hair shaved, still with his chain around her neck. How could she lack evidence? But I thought about what she'd said--""It would just be my word against his,"" which was clearly followed by the unvoiced thought: And who is going to believe me? I could easily imagine my own teenage voice whispering those same words.The more I learned about Rhoades, the more I saw parallels between us. It wasn't lost on me that while I was hitchhiking and he was driving, we would both have struggled with some of the same challenges--sleep deprivation and the hypnotic dullness of going through identical locations over and over, a world constructed of boredom and violence. And while I was getting more adept at survival, he was very likely getting more adept at killing. We both had our own systems, our own rituals, and our own beliefs about what people were really like and how they acted under pressure.I'd put off writing Rhoades, mostly because I didn't want him to write me back. The time had come to do it anyway. Mark Young said Rhoades likes to feel like an expert and that I should ask him to ""educate"" me, so while writing my letter I used permissive language, saying I wanted him ""to teach me what I did right and what I did wrong"" when I was traveling. Knowing the capacity of his sadism made this unbearable. Rhoades didn't live a double life as much as a shadowed one. There's a picture of him in leather and chains that floats around the Internet. It's actually from a Halloween party in Houston where he went as a ""slave,"" led on a chain by his wife, who was dressed as a dominatrix.Debra Davis and Rhoades met in the early '80s at a Houston bar called Chipkikkers. Rhoades was dressed that night as an airline pilot, and it was months before Davis found out he wasn't one. The remarkable thing is that when she did, she didn't dump him. But Rhoades was cunning and highly charismatic. When the FBI extradited him to Illinois, he was able to get a phone number off a waitress while shackled hand and foot and wearing an orange prison suit. This obviously doesn't recommend the waitress's judgment, but at least some of the credit has to go to Rhoades.I finally got to Davis through agent Young. He sent me a text just as I was leaving Texas saying that ""Debbie"" was ready to talk. I called as soon as I landed. Today, Davis lives in College Station, Texas, and her kids, the product of a previous marriage, are grown. She occasionally speaks on domestic violence at conferences and in classrooms at AM. She's tried to put the years with Rhoades behind her but still gets letters from him sporadically. Sometimes they're threatening, sometimes cajoling, but always manipulative.According to her, in the summer of 1985, Rhoades was driving for a trucking company based in Georgia that has an office right on I-95. I ran my story past her. When I got to the part about the sudden switch in his behavior, she got excited. ""That's him! That's exactly like him!"" she said. She also said Rhoades often left his gun at home in the beginning and could have used a knife. There were other points where she saw similarities and would say, ""That sounds like Bob,"" but these were less emphatic, and it was hard to tell what she really thought. Like Young and Lee, she had never heard of the Laughing Death Society, and since it had featured so strongly in my experience, I thought it salient. ""Don't you think that fact starts to rule him out? """"Oh no, not at all!"" she said. ""Bob was fascinated by secret societies. ""Davis mentioned the case of Colleen Stan, a 21-year-old hitchhiker who had been kidnapped in 1977 by a couple who tortured her and kept her as a sex slave for seven years while she slept in a box under their bed. Eventually she was left unbound. They kept her from running away by convincing her that a secret society called The Company would find her and bring her back. ""Bob was obsessed with how they used an imaginary secret society to keep her from running away,"" Davis said.It made sense. As a true sexual sadist, Rhoades would have been interested in a level of submission requiring no chains. He'd told Shana Holts to ""sit there and be a good girl."" Regina Walters had been seen in Chicago standing freely outside his truck in a public place. ""Do you remember what he was wearing?"" Davis asked quietly.She was the only person who asked me this, and of course I did. Or rather, I remember what he was not wearing. He was not wearing jeans. He was not wearing a T-shirt. He was not wearing flannel. His clothes were gray or blue, but that may have been the light. Debra told me that ""Bob"" always wore matching Dickies, usually dark blue. ""He liked people to think he was in uniform,"" she said.The airline pilot's outfit came to mind. ""Do you remember what his cab looked like? """"That sure sounds like Bob. When I first saw his apartment, I thought I'd walked into the showroom of a furniture store. Even in jail, his shirt and pants were always ironed and pressed. ""In Martinsburg, West Virginia, where the truck stop should be is a massive Walmart stretching flat and endless along a parking lot the size of a lake. Five years ago, the truck stop was demolished along with its restaurant. The only thing they neglected to take down is a website with the words Martinsburg TravelCenter of America flashing like a beacon online.The whole thing seemed so uncanny. Everywhere I looked, evidence of these girls was disappearing. I hadn't been able to get a copy of Shana Holts's police report because I was told there was no official suspect. Lisa Pennal's full statement, it turned out, had been destroyed for file space. Now the whole Martinsburg truck stop had been swallowed by a Walmart Supercenter.I knew from talking to the Martinsburg police that the truck stop had been under the jurisdiction of the Berkeley County sheriff. I called the office. A chipper recorded voice told me to press 1 for tas, press 2 for guns--""all other callers stay on the line!"" I finally spoke to a woman and asked if they had a homicide record for a girl who may have been found in the Martinsburg truck stop during the summer of 1985. ""We don't have any records,"" she told me. ""I can come down,"" I said. ""We don't have any records. ""In the 1990s, the Berkeley County sheriff's department's computer crashed and burned. The paper records had been destroyed for file space, and so nothing from the 1980s remained. I asked to speak to any senior officer who might have been there at the time. She told me there was only one and he had gone fishing.I spent a week on the road in Appalachia, visiting truck stops, interviewing the older truckers and waitresses. At first, I would ask about the girl in the Dumpster, but no one had heard of her, so I asked if there had ever been any women found in truck stops. Wherever I went, I was told nothing ""like that"" ever happened, which was remarkable given the numbers of bodies the FBI had tracked over the past thirty years. The newspapers were equally silent. It seems our profound fascination with serial killers is matched by an equally profound lack of interest in their victims. One library archivist explained that I was looking for the kind of news nobody wanted to read. The girl, he said, ""wasn't one of our own. She was a drifter."" I'd never heard the word ""drifter"" used in earnest. It touched a nerve I didn't know I had. I had been a drifter. If what he said was true, the trail I was on had disappeared into a field.Out of desperation I made one last attempt and swung by a smaller truck stop in Hancock, Maryland. I spoke to a woman who had worked there a long time and told her about the dead hitchhiker while she fingered the gold cross on her neck and listened. Had she ever heard about it? I asked. She shook her head; then her eyes clouded some. ""Wait a minute. There was that one girl. She was a prostitute. They found her near a Dumpster behind the restaurant at the Gateway Travel Plaza in Breezewood. She had a stocking down her throat, I think. That was way back in the early '70s, though. ""It wasn't the early '70s, it was 1987, and the woman killed was 19-year-old Lamonica Cole. I found her in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette later that night. She had been strangled at Breezewood. Another prostitute had been grabbed there as well, in 2006, but was found farther down the road with her throat slit. Neither of these women were the one I was looking for, but a sentence in the article caught my attention. It said there had been a string of prostitute murders in truck stops in the area beginning in June of 1985, which was right on the edge of my time frame.The next morning, I drove to the Gateway Travel Plaza in Breezewood, Pennsylvania. I thought that maybe in a truck stop where known murders had occurred, people would be more forthcoming. Maybe they would remember something the others hadn't. I parked in front of the family travel plaza, then walked back past a sign that read TRUCKS ONLY. The store for professional drivers was clean and quiet. I asked around until I found someone who had been there in 1985. It was a woman, probably in her midfifties. She came over and gave me an open smile. I asked her the same questions I was asking everybody: Did you ever hear about a hitchhiker in a Dumpster? ""No,"" she said. ""Did you ever hear of anything like that at all, in other times, any other bodies of women found along this stretch of I-70? ""I was in the one place where I knew for certain women had been found, one less than a hundred yards away from where she was standing. ""No,"" she said, ""I never heard of anything like that anywhere. ""I remember being in the woods off I-95. I only ran about a hundred yards before I turned and hid, because I didn't know if I was being chased. I crouched on netted twigs and breathed into my shirt to muffle the sound.</p> <p>Listening to her, it occurred to me that this investigation of mine wasn't a detective novel. It was a ghost story. The prisms of Regina Walters, Shana Holts, and Lisa Pennal refracted into a set of icons--one in the backseat of a car laughing as she leans on the headrest, one with the shorn red-gold hair and an expression of resilience, one slightly crazy and ready to fight--each casting her own light, each a hologram of girlhood.Recently, the New Jersey State Supreme Court handed down a statement on memory, describing it as complex and often unreliable. The ruling went on to question the admissibility of eyewitness testimony. ""Human memory is not like a video recording,"" they said. And they're right. It's more like a set of still photos. I remember coming down through the Blue Ridge Mountains in a truck with its brakes on fire and dropping over Chester Gap in the middle of the night when it was still hot and the air was loud with the chirping of bugs. I remember sitting in the drizzle in a truck while the crime-scene tape was strung around a Dumpster. I remember driving around Ohio howling along with Bruce Springsteen and buzzed out of my brain on Diet Cokes and being sad that the ride ended because it was a safe one and I had almost been able to be myself for a second, but that second had passed. I remember a fuel island in the blue morning light and a driver with a white shirt that stood out like a flag, and taking the turn back east, then south, and a gray day just before a storm so pressurized my ears hurt. And I remember being in the woods off I-95. I only ran about a hundred yards before I turned and hid, because I didn't know if I was being chased and needed to see. I crouched on netted twigs and breathed into my shirt to muffle the sound. The woods were blue in the gray light, which was either dusk or a coming storm. At the center of everything was my own breath. The birds went silent, and I didn't know what it meant. I watched the truck idle on the side of the road until it finally pulled off.One snowy night several months later, I was hitchhiking through Amherst, Massachusetts, and a carful of students from Hampshire College picked me up and let me stay with them. In the morning, they talked me into applying to the college. I was accepted, and that provided a thin strip of pride on which to stand while I made contact with my family. My mother was happy to pay for school. Being 16 and in college is an easier thing to talk about. It was a solution that worked for both of us and looked like redemption but didn't last. The dissonance between my emotional world and the one around me was still too great, and soon I left again, but in a more sanctioned way. I hitchhiked in Europe and settled in Vienna for a few years. I lived among artists in the Lower East Side squats. These are narratives we know. Unlike those of other young women on the road, my story was now recognizable.When I got home from West Virginia, a letter from Rhoades was waiting. It said he would see me if I promised never to say that I had seen him or what had passed between us. It was just the kind of promise a sexual predator or child molester would try to extract. He also wanted $500. I wrote him back and told him that journalistic standards wouldn't allow me to pay for interviews. I expected that to be the end of it, but I got another letter. Young was right. Rhoades liked to think of himself as an ""expert,"" and now Rhoades suggested he be paid as one. But an expert in what, I thought, killing? At the bottom of the yellow legal paper, scrawled in all caps, he wrote, ""IT WASN'T ME!!!"" I looked at the letter. He may be right, but certainly not because he's innocent. I imagined for a moment flying to Illinois. I go through the paperwork, get fingerprinted and led through a channel of air-locked doors into a room with him. He's there with his neatly pressed shirt and colossal arrogance. We do the interview, but I don't take notes. It doesn't matter what he says. After all, it's just going to be his word against mine. And who's going to believe him? That's where my fantasy ends, in a game of ""Who Is Credible Now? ""The same week that I got the letter from Rhoades, the senior officer from the Berkeley County sheriff's department who had been fishing returned. He said that no girls had ever been found in a Dumpster at the Martinsburg, West Virginia, truck stop, and I had no reason not to believe him.One story Debra Davis told still haunts me. She was on a trip with her husband, Bob, the last she ever took in his truck. They were heading west on I-10 and stopped somewhere in Arizona at a busy truck stop. By the restaurant door was a young woman with a baby, trying to get a ride. Debra said she looked about 18 or 19 and desperate. Debra wanted to give her money or do something. Her own sister had been on the street, and she was overwhelmed by the woman at the door and didn't want to just walk away. Rhoades saw what Debra was looking at. He came around behind her and grabbed her shoulders. He turned her slowly toward the girl and pointed. ""You see that, Debbie,"" he whispered in her ear. ""She's one of the invisible people.

The reporter, Pushp Sharma, assumed the identity of 'Acharya Atal' from the 'Srimad Bhagvat Gita Prachar Samiti'. At various times he would refer to his organisation as the 'sangathan', and many of the media executives he filmed assumed he was from, or was close to, the Nagpur-based Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).</p> <p>The pitch 'Acharya Atal' made at these media houses, with some variations, was that in the run up to the 2019 election, his organisation wanted to promote the Hindutva agenda, beginning with 'soft Hindutva' content for the first three months with largely religious messaging, followed by 'semi-political' material which would include 'character assassination' of opposition leaders Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, followed also by content that would eventually help polarise Hindus and Muslims.</p> <p>In the first part of 'Operation 136' - which derives its name from the rank India got in the World Press Freedom Index of 2017 - cobrapost.com has reproduced the excerpts of interactions its undercover journalist had with India TV, which belongs to Rajat Sharma, an editor known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India's largest Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran, local Uttar Pradesh channel Hindi Khabar, the entertainment and news television company SAB Group, the English newsaper DNA (Daily News and Analysis) which is owned by Zee and Dainik Bhaskar, Amar Ujala, the news agency UNI, the entertainment channel 9X Tashan, the UP news channel Samachar Plus, the Uttarakhand channel HNN 24x7, the Hindi newspapers Punjab Kesari and Swatantra Bharat, web portals ScoopWhoop and Rediff.com, IndiaWatch, Hindi newspaper Aaj and the influential Lucknow-based news channel,  Sadhna Prime News.</p> <p>These platforms represent some of the largest north Indian newspapers and TV channels. Some of those recorded include big names in the media industry, including Pradeep Guha, formerly a top executive at the Times of India group and now at 9X Tashan.</p> <p>On Monday, Cobrapost.com uploaded excerpts from the video recordings the portal made of the undercover reporter's conversations with media executives at these firms.</p> <p>The degree of enthusiasm displayed varies from media house to media house but the response 'Acharya Atal' drew was uniformly positive. None of the business representatives of the media houses shown seemed to consider it problematic that a client wanted to use their platform to influence the upcoming election to polarise voters and tarnish the reputation of opposition leaders, or that the boundaries between advertising and news coverage was being erased.</p> <p>Their willingness to implement an election-related paid political campaign is a direct challenge to Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who tweeted in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy that ""any covert or overt attempt to misuse social media including Facebook to influence India's electoral process through undesirable means will neither be tolerated, nor be permitted.""</p> <p>Explaining the rationale for its latest sting, Cobrapost.com said in a press release, ""What Operation 136 establishes, for the first time in the history of Independent India and the world at large: Yes, Indian media houses do have the propensity to `influence India's electoral process through undesirable means'.""</p> <p>Interestingly, some of the media houses expressed a willingness to take payment in cash so that the transaction was kept off the books and GST could be evaded.</p> <p>'We can do any kind of work for you'</p> <p>In an echo of the recent Channel 4 expose of Cambridge Analytica - where executives promised dirty tricks to a reporter posing as a Sri Lankan businessman seeking the agency's help in engineering a favourable election result in his country - at least one of the media executives was filmed making similar claims. According to cobrapost.com, Dainik Jagran's area manager of Bihar-Jharkhand-Odisha offered their undercover reporter some unconventional services, including sex workers:</p> <p>""Insisting that he can get anything anti-establishment published in his paper, Singh reveals more darker sides of his character.

Green's family moved to Mobile, Alabama, when he was four years old and he was raised there. He learned Hawaiian string guitar from the age of seven and graduated to steel guitar. He was playing professionally by the time he was 10, and recalls, 'I played in clubs a couple of nights a week with a rhythm guitarist called Emmanuel Abates, who was also a yo-yo champion. He wasn't a very good guitarist and eventually he went back to his yo-yos.' Green studied psychology at the University of Southern Mississippi, but he left at the age of 19 to seek fame in Nashville. In December 1956 he joined Faron Young's road band and stayed for 18 months. During that time, he played steel guitar on his first session, George Jones' 'Too Much Water Runs Under The Bridge'. He returned to Mobile and later came back to Nashville as a shoe salesman. When he told one customer that he could not afford $75 to renew his union card, she renewed it for him - she was the widow of the publisher Fred Rose.</p> <p>The first successful session on which Green played was Warner Mack's 'The Bridge Washed Out' in 1965. For the next 15 years, 'the steelworker' averaged 400 sessions a year, which included 'It's Four In The Morning' (Faron Young), 'Easy Lovin'' (Freddie Hart) and the Byrds' seminal country rock album, Sweetheart Of The Rodeo. He says, ' Bob Dylan had hinted and flirted with the steel guitar before the Byrds, but he'd only let Pete Drake colour the songs very lightly. 'You Ain't Goin' Nowhere' took a whole day to record, which was a whole new revolution for me. I was used to sessions that were highly organized and where everyone was clock-watching.' He also played on Paul McCartney's 'Sally G' but turned down a US tour because he did not want to lose work in Nashville.</p> <p>Green made several solo records, mostly easy-listening country music, although his technique is skilfully demonstrated on 'I Can See Clearly Now'. He popularized the blocking technique, used by Jimmy Day in the 50s, whereby the palm of the picking hand is used to mute the strings in order to lose the ringing effect. Green, who was not a solo attraction in the USA, made successful appearances at the Wembley Country Music Festival and his 1979 three-week UK tour with Billie Jo Spears was the longest he had been away from Nashville since 1964. He also worked in the UK with his fellow session musicians Charlie McCoy and Pig Robbins. He says, 'It's laughable when I read of Nashville session men getting together after hours and having a jam session. We play enough music in the studio. We'd rather get drunk and have a good time.' In 1988 Green was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame.</p> <p>Source: The Encyclopedia of Popular Music by Colin Larkin. Licensed from Muze.</p>","Yes"

(Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News)              On a sleepy Sunday morning at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees are scattered around the complex, preparing for the exhibition season that begins only two days later. Pitchers take fielding practice on Fields 3 and 4, while Alex Rodriguez headlines a group taking batting practice on the main field, drawing a big crowd of spectators, both in the stands and behind the cage. Back on Field 2, the one tucked away on the right side of the development, four hitters take BP while a dozen or two onlookers watch from behind a chain-link fence. Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner go through their routines, spraying balls to all fields. Ramon Flores, a Triple-A outfielder, works on his swing with the hopes of impressing the coaching staff. Then Aaron Judge steps into the cage. It's his power and all-around game that keep eyes - including those of coach Joe Espada (l.) - fixed on the 22-year-old prospect. (Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News)       You can't help but take notice of the sound. Ball meeting bat creates a loud noise that makes you wonder if you've mistakenly wandered onto a shooting range. Judge -- a 6-7, 275-pound specimen that looks like he should be playing right defensive end rather than right field -- rips one line drive after another, trying to perfect an approach that has seemingly put him on the fast track to stardom. The second-to-last ball he hits clears the wall in left-center field with ease, a shot that catches his veteran teammates' attention. The next ball is launched to straightaway center field, where it crashes into the top area of the black batter's eye, a blast that might have landed on Dale Mabry Highway -- or perhaps on the 50-yard-line of Raymond James Stadium across the street -- if the big black screen hadn't intervened. ""You just got that one,"" Gardner jokes, almost at a loss for words for the power display he's just witnessed. Judge is the Yankees' top hitting prospect, a towering package of power, athleticism and plate discipline. Mason Williams, a fellow outfield prospect, calls him ""a created player"" -- as in the player he creates when he plays Madden 2015 on his Xbox. A first-round draft pick selected 32nd overall in 2013, Judge hit .333/.428/.530 with nine home runs and 45 RBI in 65 games at Low-A Charleston last season, earning a midseason promotion to High-A Tampa. Who are these guys? Meet the 2015 Yankees        The move didn't slow him down. Judge hit .283/.411/.442 with eight homers and 33 RBI in 66 games, firmly establishing himself as a rising star in a system desperate for one. ""I think power in general is a scarcity, but especially righthanded power,"" said Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees' VP of amateur scouting. ""It gives him a great value to us, but so does his makeup and a number of other things that go with him. He's not just a guy that turns and launches; he's a good runner, a good thrower and a graceful athlete with great plate discipline. I think that gets lost in his size."" As Judge shot past the 6-foot mark in high school, the football schools began actively recruiting him. A wide receiver and defensive end, Judge received letters from Notre Dame, UCLA, Michigan State and Stanford among others. ""It was fun going up against little cornerbacks,"" said Judge, who grew up in Linden, Calif., about 90 miles east of San Francisco. ""I was 6-7 and they were about 5-8 standing across from me. It was pretty funny."" Football was fun, but baseball was his passion. Judge was drafted in the 30th round of the 2010 draft by Oakland, but choosing to attend Fresno State rather than signing was an easy choice. ""I didn't think I was ready -- physically or mentally -- to get into pro ball,"" Judge said. ""I knew that a couple years at Fresno would help that out. I was going to college the whole way."" In his first season in the Yankee organization (over two levels) Aaron Judge put up some impressive numbers. (Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News)     ""He was raw,"" Oppenheimer said. After graduating high school at about 220 pounds, Judge started lifting weights, filling out his frame with another 30 or 40 pounds. He mashed his way through college, earning first-team All-Conference honors in all three seasons. Judge led the Bulldogs in home runs, doubles and RBI during his junior season, but it was his .461 on-base percentage that stood out to him. ""That's what wins ballgames,"" Judge said. ""If you get on base, the guys behind you can drive you in."" Following his sophomore season, Judge played in the Cape Cod League, a veritable training ground for potential draftees. There's a day during the summer when all position players in the league are brought to Fenway Park for a workout, a session that stuck with Oppenheimer as he was preparing for the draft nearly a year later. ""I distinctly remember sitting there, watching this guy -- finally -- in a big-league park,"" Oppenheimer said. ""Cape fields are basically high school fields, so it's really neat to see these guys at Fenway and gauge it. He was one of the few guys that was rattling balls up in the lights. His tools were all there."" The size and strength stand out -- observers regularly draw comparisons to Dave Winfield and Giancarlo Stanton -- but it's what Judge does off the field that leads the Yankees to believe they may have found a special player. Judge, who the Yankees drafted with a first-round pick in 2013, is a top hitting prospect. (Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News)     ""From everything I've ever heard from the player development side, this is a leader of men,"" general manager Brian Cashman said. ""People gravitate to him in the weight room, on the field and in the clubhouse. He's the guy that people turn to to show them the way."" P. J. Pilittere, Judge's hitting coach in Tampa last season, learned right away what type of teammate the youngster was. ""In his first game when he got promoted last year, he came up in a big spot and he didn't get the job done,"" Pilittere said. ""I wanted to see how the kid responded to that. He came back to the dugout, put his helmet and bat away and immediately started cheering for the next guy at the plate. That told me all I needed to know about him."" Pilittere played eight seasons in the Yankees' minor-league system, attending big-league camp with the likes of Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada. He's not ready to anoint Judge as a superstar just yet, but Pilittere believes his temperament is ideal for success. ""The good ones that play this game can control their emotions; it's a special talent,"" Pilittere said. ""The fact that he can already do it is a promising sign of things to come. He's a genuine kid that loves the game and wants to be better."" The Yankees use a metric called exit velocity, which measures the speed at which a ball travels off a hitter's bat. Assistant GM Billy Eppler said Judge's number ranks in the 90th percentile of major-league hitters, evidence of the damage he can do with each swing. ""We like the total package,"" Eppler said. ""Power is what people like to talk about, especially with a guy of his size. Watching him take BP is fun; it's like going to a long-drive contest. ""But watch him go get a ball in the gap, watch him throw, watch him do the other things. Everybody wants to see a bomb in the batter's box, but we just want him to have a quality at-bat and win every pitch. He does a lot of things we like our hitters to do. He fits our offensive DNA."" The Yankees haven't drafted and developed an All-Star position player in pinstripes since Jeter. Judge could change that. In big-league camp for the first time, Judge is doing everything he can to take advantage of the opportunity. He's picked Carlos Beltran's brain about what it takes to succeed in the majors and watched the way Mark Teixeira prepares each day. He knows he's likely ticketed for Double-A Trenton to open the season, but Judge figures as long as he's here, why not dream big? ""I just want to give them something to think about,"" Judge said. ""Try to soak up as much as I can, talk to everybody, learn as much as I can. Put on a show and make it tough for them to send me across the street."" The Core Four is gone. Robinson Cano, once believed to be the man to take the baton from Jeter, now plays in Seattle. Could Judge be the next great homegrown Yankee? ""That's everybody's dream,"" Judge said. ""Even as a little kid, you want to grow up and be one of the legends, one of the greatest of all-time. One of my dreams is to be one of the next great ones, but I know I have to work hard every day to work toward that goal. ""This is where we all want to be. Getting a taste of it here, I want more. Now I have to go out there and get it.""</p>","Yes"

It would certainly have ensured the second half wasn't the non-event that followed.</p> <p>A home side basically content to sit on their advantage created little and were caused few problems by a Posh team lacking their usual spark and having now ditched their diamond. 'Like a five-a-side' was Ferguson's rather accurate assessment of the final chunk of a match he will wish to forget as soon as possible.</p> <p>His men did begin brightly after the break. Aaron Mclean was millimetres away from getting his head on a Boyd delivery before a goalbound header from the wideman was hooked clear by defender Rob Edwards.</p> <p>But chances were at a premium at both ends. The classy Charlie Adam was a whisker away from increasing Posh's arrears before substitute Krystian Pearce almost marked his first Championship appearance for the club by laying the opportunity for a third goal on a plate for home substitute Ben Burgess. Lewis came to the rescue with an excellent save, but the damage had long been done.</p> <p>It was instantly forgettable stuff - apart from for one man. Forty year-old mascot Paul Myland (an honour apparently received for recently fathering a child) is probably the only person from this part of the world that will have any fond memories of the occasion.</p> <p>Questionable role in both goals but one excellent save late on</p> <p>Best performer in the back four. Could have offered more attacking wise</p> <p>Badly beaten for second goal and well below his best</p> <p>Poor defensive display by his high standards. Distribution not great either</p> <p>Uncharacteristically poor performance. Appeared shaky and panicky with the ball and substituted</p> <p>Never shirked a tackle, but positional play and passing can both be much better</p> <p>Busy in midfield, but missed excellent chance just before half-time</p> <p>Always looked likeliest to unlock their defence, despite limited time with the ball</p> <p>Typically strong shift but couldn't take early chance to level and little went right</p> <p>Found it tough going up top with shortage of service a concern</p> <p>Chris Whelpdale (for Coutts 46 mins): Little joy out wide or when roving centrally	5</p>","No"

Reebok, hoping to create a commercial with a cinematic feel.","<p>IN 1996, when Deborah Johnson, a producer of television commercials, hired Zack Snyder to direct a commercial for Reebok, she was looking for someone with a cinematic style: action with an epic feel.</p> <p>''You didn't know I was cute when you hired me?'' Mr. Snyder asked a week ago, gently poking her with a tattooed arm, on which Deborah was etched in large gothic capital letters. Mr. Snyder, 38, was also basking in the success of the first feature film he directed, a remake of ''Dawn of the Dead,'' which has grossed $101 million worldwide.</p> <p>No, she hired him for his reel, not his good looks, recalled Ms. Johnson, 35, who was then working for the Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising agency in New York. At the shoot, which was in California, she raced the natural light to go for the extra shot, a trait dear to a director's heart. ''She was a bubbly, beautiful girl, who was sharp and on it,'' Mr. Snyder said.</p> <p>But he was married, and she was dating the art director for the commercial.</p> <p>Cut to 2002. Ms. Johnson, working for another agency, hired Mr. Snyder again, this time for a commercial in New Zealand for Soft & Dri deodorant. ''He was charming -- a lot of directors are so difficult -- and he was collaborative,'' she said.</p> <p>She had just ended a five-year-relationship, but assumed Mr. Snyder was still married. Over dinner that first night in Auckland he said he was single. She recalls saying: ''Oh. Really?''</p> <p>But he remembers thinking: ''I'm not going to have a woman in my life. I'm going to work like a banshee. I'm going to have six children to support.'' Mr. Snyder had four children with his former wife and two with a woman he did not marry.</p> <p>Though problems arose during the shooting, he and Ms. Johnson worked seamlessly, he noticed. When the glamour girl they hired could not ride a bucking bronco, Mr. Snyder and Ms. Johnson improvised, putting a man in a wig on the horse and shooting the actress only in close-up.</p> <p>In the off-hours, they rode boogie boards on white-water rapids. ''I was never so afraid,'' Ms. Johnson recalled. ''I was trying to impress him.''</p> <p>By the end of the two-week shoot, they were in love. They traveled between her home in New York and his in Pasadena, Calif., and telephoned nightly. In January 2003, when Mr. Snyder started shooting ''Dawn of the Dead'' in Toronto, she flew to meet him every weekend.</p> <p>By September he presented her with a package deal. He asked her to live with him and to become president of Cruel and Unusual Inc., his film production company in Pasadena. The next month he flew to New York with a sweetener: a fortune cookie with a diamond ring inside, which he placed by the Chinese take-out they had ordered.</p> <p>At dinner's end he asked why she was not eating the cookie.</p> <p>She: ''It's a little stale.''</p> <p>He: ''It's perfect. Eat it.''</p> <p>By January, she had moved to Pasadena to be with him.</p> <p>Friends says they don't hang out with celebrities, spending weekends instead caring for four of his children. Still, some friends and business associates wonder if they will become a Hollywood power couple. ''There are a lot of very successful husband-wife teams in Hollywood,'' said Todd Feldman, Mr. Snyder's agent.</p> <p>On Sept. 25 Mr. Snyder and Ms. Johnson were married by the Rev. David Stout at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Manhattan and then rode a double-decker bus to the reception at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on the Lower East Side. People on the street clapped and whistled.</p> <p>Mr. Snyder and Ms. Johnson are optimists, in love as in business. They are waiting for the DVD release of ''Dawn of the Dead'' this month, timed for Halloween. And they hope to produce and direct a film version of ''300,'' a graphic novel by Frank Miller about the ancient battle of Thermopylae.</p> <p>And do they plan to produce children together?</p> <p>She: ''We want to.''</p> <p>He: ''Are you crazy?''</p> <p>Photos: FIFTH AVENUE, SEPT. 25 -- After the ceremony at St. Bartholomew's Church the couple led the wedding party down to the reception in a double-decker bus.

Like most teen-agers, Rehe was excited about getting her driver's license. Unlike most teen-agers, Rehe had already earned enough money to buy her first car. The tennis player from Highland, Calif., turned professional at 15 after having disposed of her opposition in the juniors. She got to the third round at Wimbledon, became a pro at the U.S. Open and won the next tournament she entered. She has an agent. So, getting a driver's license is a big deal?It is to Rehe, who has made an effort to remain a teen-ager as long as she can in the grown-up tennis world. She lives at home, she attends San Gorgonio High School when she can and takes correspondence courses when she can't, and--the true brand of a teen-ager--she has braces on her teeth. Even with all those outward signs, Rehe can't help but seem older and remote to her peers. Tennis has aged Rehe, as much as she has fought the process.Rehe began playing tennis as a 7-year-old. At the time, her parents had nothing further in mind than giving an energetic kid something to do. Rehe rose to No. 1 in all the junior age divisions from 12-and-under to 18s. She also became the first person to achieve dual No. 1 rankings in the 14s and 16s. This year, Rehe was named Junior Player of the Year by World Tennis magazine.With that record, Rehe barely paused before deciding to turn pro. ""It wasn't a difficult decision,"" she said. ""I had accomplished everything I could as a junior. I had two years to wait until college; I was playing fairly well, so I did it. ""Rehe's game changed, as well. She left her coach of six years, Robert Lansdorp, in an effort to expand her skills. Lansdorp is noted for developing baseliners with two-handed backhands and an allergy to the net. Rehe is a steady shotmaker but wanted to develop her volleys to exploit her 5-11 frame. ""I'm not changing my game; I'm trying to add to it,"" Rehe said. ""I want to come to the net more, when I have a chance. I'm looking for a more complete, all-around game. I'm working on everything. I'm getting stronger and maturing, and that will make a difference. ""Rehe got her first tour victory in September at Salt Lake City in the Virginia Slims of Utah. That win lifted her to No. 40 on the Womens' Tennis Assn. computer. She rose again to No. 27 and this week to No. 19. ""I've made a big step in self-confidence since I've turned pro,"" she said. ""I'll play anybody. I've won two of the three tournaments since I've turned pro, and that helps. ""Rehe won her second tour title last week in Florida, surviving a tough draw to beat Carling Bassett in the semifinals and 15-year-old Gabriela Sabatini in the final. Both matches went longer than 2 1/2 hours. ""Against Gabriela, I felt real loose,"" Rehe said. ""There was no pressure on me; she was the third seed. I have a lot of respect for her and what she's accomplished this year. ""We both were coming to the net when we had an opportunity. I've always had great luck in Florida. Maybe because I've played there so often, the people feel they know me. I've never had so many people behind me. It's a great feeling. ""Next stop for Rehe is the Pan Pacific Open next month in Japan. Until then, Rehe lives with her parents, Hans and Barbel, and her younger brother, Mark, and the family's seven cats and one dog. Rehe's parents, who fled East Germany in 1958, are not serious tennis players, but Stephanie's mother occasionally travels with her. That, Stephanie says, helps her keep a clear perspective. ""Tennis is on my mind most right now,"" she said. ""I just want to be happy. My school is very supportive of my tennis; my friends are supportive. I'm really happy with the way things have turned out, and I'm a little surprised. I'm just going to go in and play the best I can and see how it works out.""</p> <p>This World of Tennis Is on Wheels</p>","Yes"

The winger has never played higher than League One but is clearly under consideration as a potential target for Villa boss Steve Bruce. This is what we know about Maddison...   Maddison came through the ranks at Newcastle United before turning professional in 2012. Upon his release in 2013, reserve team manager Willie Donachie, father of Villa's head of medicine Danny, said he 'had a lot to learn'. Maddison signed for North East non-league side Gateshead and made a name for himself in the National League. He scored 13 league goals in 34 appearances before being snapped up by Peterborough United in 2014 for a club record fee of PS250,000 which could eventually rise to PS500,000. He has gone from strength to strength at Posh. He scored six goals in his first 12 matches and has scored 24 in total in two and a half years. Maddison has quite the fan club at London Road. The following extract was taken from his Wikipedia page... ""He is the current top assist-maker in England for the 2016-17 season, and has drawn several comparisons to Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil. ""Pundit Gary Lineker has been very outspoken on his 'wand of a left foot', and Diego Maradona himself has labelled him as the heir to his throne."" Maddison has become known for his incisive dribbling with the ball and shooting ability in League One. The majority of his goals tend to arrive after he has drifted in from the right wing and let fly with his trusty left peg. He has plenty of pace and knows how to find the net from set pieces. You can watch a stunning free-kick he scored against Oldham Athletic below...</p> <p>Managers send scouts to plenty of matches and judging by the number of players we have seen linked with Villa already in the transfer window, Bruce has several targets for each position. Maddison is a talented player who is flourishing in League One, but whether he would be able to make the step up and have an immediate impact on a team fighting to be in the Championship promotion shake-up is another matter.

He also has a degree of notoriety associated with his time in the radical activist group Direct Action (sometimes called the Squamish Five or the Vancouver Five), for which he ended up going to prison. I have always respected Gerry not only for his songs, but for his association with that group, though not because I believe in the methods that they used - see my interview with near-casualty Terry Chikowski here for some thoughts on that, though note that Gerry Hannah was not involved in that particular action. No, I respect Gerry because, as a young man growing up, discovering politics more or less through punk rock, I believed, admittedly naively, that punk was intended as a seriously revolutionary social movement, not just a style of music or fashion or entertaining way of standing out in the crowd. Back in those days, I took various slogans that I encountered on the backs of DOA albums (or agit-prop incitements to action in Crass lyrics) rather seriously; and when DOA recorded ""Burn It Down"" in 1983 in support of Hannah, as part of a Free the Five ""Emergency Issue"" benefit single, I bought it in more ways than one. I read the ""Letter from Gerry"" contained therein, and felt both scared and excited to be involved in a form of music that was actually (to all appearances) intent on revolution, or at least stirring things up a bit. I was fifteen back then. Times were different (maybe).</p> <p>Thirty years or so later, I'm older, milder, tired-er, and maybe a smidgen wiser, and I realize that when (or if?) the revolution finally comes I will probably be among those promptly purged, which I don't look much forward to (and hardly advocate). I still respect Gerry, however, for walking the talk of punk back in the day. He didn't know that you were never actually supposed to do that - that punk in fact WAS (mostly) just a style of music, a fashion, an entertaining way of standing out in the crowd. Particularly in North America, there was actually no real threat to it at all (except maybe to the punks themselves, when rednecks or cops beat the shit out of them). It was (mostly) all bark and no bite - something which Repo Man director Alex Cox and I talk about this elsewhere on the Big Takeover site (Hannah's name comes up). I still listen to punk, and still respect idealistic present-day punk bands like The Rebel Spell (see here and here for my interviews with them) for remaining committed to social justice, environmentalism, and so forth; but I don't really believe their music, or anyone's, can change the world all that much, no matter how good it is. It's enough that it's smart, engaging, and potent. Besides, as Gerry's former bandmate in the Subhumans, Mike Graham , once said to me, when being interviewed about the Subhumans under-rated comeback New Dark Age Parade , ""It's always kinda hard to say what kind of effect anything cultural can have - a book or a movie or anything. Can it have a practical effect? I dunno. But I think it's important to kinda keep, uh, making cultural stuff that's aware of the situation. The only alternative to that is having a culture that's completely devoid of meaning."" (And Lord knows we have enough of that in the world).</p> <p>While Gerry Hannah was still in prison, I briefly owned his Songs From Underground cassette, an album of acoustic folk songs that he recorded in jail and released in 1985. I loved at least one of the songs on it beyond all measure: ""Like a Fire,"" which stood out even to my youthful ears as a classic of depressive folk music, and which stands up today as being every bit as grim and beautiful as the most heart-rending offerings of Townes van Zandt (with the added value of having political weight to it). Problem was, I wasn't all that much of a fan of depressive folk music at that time. I was interested in hardcore, and the at times pretty, gentle, sincere music elsewhere on Songs From Underground (there's a song called ""Summertime,"" for instance) didn't do much for me. It wasn't bad - I didn't gag the way I would have if I'd heard, at that opinionated and excessive age, his rather New Agey solo synthesizer stuff, Whereabouts Unknown , that he also put out on cassette, a couple of years later. But I didn't really dig it, and after a few months of listening to it, I sold my copy of Songs From Underground (incidentally, to the same Vancouver record dealer, Ty Scammell , who acquired some notoreity for his unearthing the New Creation 's Troubled and passing it on to outsider music scout James Brouwer ). Who knows where that copy of that cassette is now. Someone is trying to sell one on Discogs as I write this for $199.99. It's not actually an unreasonable price, for the artifact-oriented.</p> <p>In point of fact, I kinda wish Gerry had reissued Songs From Underground - maybe on vinyl. It has the charm of being the original, historic recording, and though Hannah makes clear in the liner notes to Coming Home that the earlier recordings' limitations irk him, I've never actually minded the production of it. Some of it sounds pretty great, considering the limited resources he had at his disposal (the version of ""Living With The Lies"" off the Terminal City Ricochet soundtrack is taken straight from the cassette). But those who know Gerry know he's a bit of a perfectionist, and he probably has less fondness for some of those songs nowadays (they age unequally well, and a couple of songs, like ""Cold Kechika Wind,"" do seem a little overwrought and youthful now, even though I miss their absence on Coming Home).</p> <p>But that's neither here nor there. Instead of a reissue, Gerry Hannah has re-recorded seven of the best of the songs on the old cassette, with a variety of musicians providing (mostly) folky accompaniment on banjo, cello, fiddle and so forth. He's augmented these re-recordings with seven previously unheard songs, many of a piece with his prison material. The CD, Coming Home, can be previewed on his bandcamp and ordered through CD Baby . For the record, the songs that survive from Songs From Underground are ""Rejuvenation,"" ""Living With the Lies,"" ""Lost in the Night,"" ""Sure Looks That Way,"" ""Holy American Empire,"" ""Like a Fire,"" and ""The Madness.""</p> <p>Here are some reactions to the new CD, track by track:</p> <p>""You Can Take It From Me"" begins with 70's-style guitar soloing (from Mark Campbell , one of three lead guitarists credited on the album) over driving acoustic folk, with plenty of mandolin from Scott Fletcher . It's actually more of a rock song than a folk song; it has a nice angry bite to it, gets the blood up. The song, the liner notes explain, describes being lectured by a full-of-himself parole officer, who tells Hannah to give up his political commitments and lead a normal middle class life; the best lyric seizes on a nice concrete image from the guy's office, that ""the naugahyde's real but the flowers are fake,"" which immediately hooks into the brain and stakes out a corner. The image says far more about the world that we're living in than any single concrete image in a song usually does, and resonates against everyone's experience of how phony our current world can be. This is probably my favourite of the new songs (or at least previously unreleased ones, since a lot of these were written around the same time as the Songs From Underground material). It's a great song to kick things off with.</p> <p>""Rejuvenation,"" which is one of the more inspiring songs on the album, gets more of a country treatment, mostly courtesy of Jenny Bice , who plays violin, though Brad Gordon's lead is pretty twangy, too, when the solo comes around. I'm not sure about this one, frankly. It's still a good song, showing the singer's self-talk as he reaffirms his beliefs, but it wasn't one of my favourites on Songs From Underground . It's got some very full instrumentation, lots going on, but this is the one song on the album where the production or the mixing or something isn't quite up to snuff. The most amusing moment comes when Hannah revisits his assertion that there's right and wrong and ""no in-between,"" counselling in some between-verse patter against absolutism, in a line that was missing from the original recording. So this is not quite the same guy who recorded these songs in the 1980's. To be honest, I prefer Gerry Hannah when he's grim and pessimistic, probably because pessimism gives me an excuse for inaction. ""Rejuvenation"" is probably better suited to people actually trying to make a difference in the world.</p> <p>The next two songs are both songs of experience. ""Same Old Song Again"" is an inquiry into relationships, driven by Hannah's at times excessive introspectiveness; as with the Subhumans' ""Nowhere To Run Anymore,"" it either will or won't connect with listeners, if they have had similar experiences (discovering that you're playing out an old pattern in a new relationship). By me, the best part is an instrumental bridge around the two minute mark, a cool bit of riffage that pops up again near the end. The cello, from Vancouver's Peggy Lee , is nicely ethereal; she's an intense and interesting player on the jazz scene here, and it's quite cool that she pops up on this album.</p> <p>The instrumentation is even richer and more accomplished on ""In The Final Days,"" which begins with a nice line of acoustic guitar and some dark, bluegrassy backwoods banjo that reminds one of Clarence Ashley or something, from someone named Jason Homey . The song deals with activists in prison, and whether their sacrifice is worth it (Hannah concludes it was). It's very much of a piece with Songs From Underground , though it's not from those sessions. Again, it's a hard one for me to connect with lyrically, since I've never been in a place remotely like the one Hannah is writing from. ""In these times of withered dreams/ It seems we've lost the sun/ All the work that took so long/ it seems it's all undone/ So many gains lay by the roadside/ so many freedoms lost/ But life cannot be won from death/ Except without some cost..."" Some nice background vocals on this one, and effective reverb on the guitar (Mark Campbell again).</p> <p>""Half-Life"" moves back towards something rock oriented, with a strong rhythm guitar track keeping it propulsive; the whole thing sounds cool enough that I don't mind that I don't really agree where Hannah's coming from lyrically - or at best don't really understand it. He talks somewhat obliquely about pornography as ""mutilated nature/ married to machines,"" describes it in terms of ""symptoms"" and ""disease,"" and somehow even works in a Wizard of Oz reference (?!). I don't really mind pornography that much, though, personally. Maybe I'm just warped by decades of jerking off to magazines and computers, but I'm still more of a fan of Robin Bougie and Cinema Sewer , and his attempts to remove the shame and stigma from porn consumption and bring it out into public discourse. If the way out is the way forward, then that seems the path to be on. Gerry may well feel like the way back is best, however. Direct Action had a decidedly old-school feminist side to them. This led to a splinter group, the Wimmin's Fire Brigade - including Hannah's then-partner Julie Belmas - firebombing a video store distributing porn in BC, Red Hot Video. (Should she ever write her memoirs it will likely be the most interesting chapter). Anyhow: that's a nicely discordant, VU-ish guitar solo, with backmasked music swirling from headphone to headphone, and there's some cool percussion. It's an enjoyable listen but I just don't grok it.</p> <p>...and here's a very country version of ""Living With The Lies!"" Hannah has given it a markedly different, punchier arrangement, which is a smart idea, since this is the most easily accessed song from his old cassette, thanks to the Terminal City Ricochet soundtrack (which comes free on CD if you buy the DVD from Alternative Tentacles , note). It's a good version, good song, one of his more passionate moments. He makes the point in the liner notes that the song was not written about Julie Belmas, which, apparently, was something she came to believe. I am not going to write much about that here, because a) I don't want to have to do the work required to get the details right, because b) what was said by whom and why is no doubt contentious; because c) I don't want to tread on anyone's toes, and because d) I kind of agree with William S. Burroughs ' sage advice to never get involved in a boy and girl fight. The song's not about Belmas anyhow. Great song, great version of it - though I kind of wish Terminal City Ricochet had immortalized ""Like a Fire"" instead.</p> <p>The next tune, ""Lost in the Night,"" has some nice details in the production, again with Peggy Lee doing some really interesting, haunting stuff on cello and some powerful guitar leads (from the Subhumans' Mike Graham himself!). It's a song very directly about fear, and fighting it, taking you inside the thought processes that led to Hannah's radicalization: ""You've got to smash/ you've got to break/ the tools that forge/ this nightmare state."" An interesting re-working of a song I never really paid much time to on the cassette; it's harder to overlook here, a definite improvement on the original, which definitely benefits a full band. The ""broken child tied to a stake"" - now could THAT be a reference to Julie?</p> <p>The next song, ""Sure Looks That Way,"" is my second favourite song on Songs From Underground , and foregrounds the pessimistic side of Hannah's spectrum. It's a little less grim on Coming Home than it was initially, but Codeine 's cover version sort of cornered the market on grim reinterpretations of this particular song, and the more upbeat, more-or-less country arrangement makes a nice counterpoint to the chorus (""We're dead, I know it/ Sure looks that way to me/ We're dead I know it/ Just look around and see."") Hannah kind of apologizes for his pessimism in the liner notes; it is pretty interesting that anyone with so grim a sensibility could have ever roused himself to political action, or anything beyond sitting on the couch moaning about how shitty everything is.</p> <p>Following ""Sure Looks That Way,"" we have another song about relationships, ""Awake Again."" Pretty mandolin from Scott Fletcher, simple and sincere images about being transformed by love. It's a nice, touching, heartfelt song. I hope it was written about the woman that Hannah is now with. That would be a nice thing for both of them.</p> <p>And then there's the boy-and-girl fight rearing up in earnest: ""The Woman Reborn,"" which deals with Hannah's crushing disappointment at seeing his then-partner and co-urban guerrila Julie Belmas at her sentencing appeal, turning on her co-defendants (an act he characterizes as a ""betrayal"" in his liner notes). This is a painful song to listen to, with emotions that are, again, rather hard to identify with, since they describe a moment in a relationship that is hard to imagine oneself in (which is just as well, to be honest; it's bad enough to have relationships end in recrimination and regret, without adding trials and prison sentences to the mix, to say nothing of the meddlings of the nascent Canadian security service CSIS and such, helpfully helping to turn people against each other). It no doubt will be the most controversial song on the album; it's accusatory and angry, but also very, very sad. To be honest, I feel a bit uncomfortable with this song. I hope that something positive comes out of making it public. There was a time when I slathered for inside information as to the workings of Direct Action, and people still on that page will want to hear this tune, but I lost enthusiasm for that kind of voyeurism when I realized just how much certain people could stand to be hurt by re-opening some of these wounds...</p> <p>Then we have the best take on one of the Songs From Underground, ""Holy American Empire."" It's completely reworked into a rock song, faster than the original, and there's Mike Graham again. He's a seriously under-appreciated punk guitarist, and he soars on this. This is a good song on Songs From Underground , but everything about it is improved here - the arrangement, the level of anger and intensity, the conviction of the delivery; it's another high point on Coming Home.</p> <p>""Like a Fire,"" the next song, is just a great one, as I say above. It's a bit of a stronger version of it than on Songs From Underground , in terms of the muscularity of the delivery, with added instrumentation, but it doesn't necessarily improve on the previous recording, which has a nice minimal starkness to it somewhat more appropriate to the subject matter. ""Have you seen the young/ playing in the street/ learning to be cruel/ learning how to cheat/ Have you seen the old/ distance in their eyes/ walking down the road/ using up their lives/ Life is like a fire/ It can burn you til you're gone/ Dreams go up in smoke/ Still you struggle on."" Some of Gerry's finest lyrics. Interestingly, the ""can"" in there modifies and somewhat lessens the original chorus, which just reads, ""life is like a fire/ burns you til you're gone."" On the other hand, Hannah omits the ""cheer-'em-up"" lyric tagged on at the end, affirming that the listener is not alone. That's a good move. Let's take our hopelessness straight, thanks; that final lyric always rang a bit false, anyhow.</p> <p>Then there's the best overtly country song on the album, ""Winding Ribbon of Dreams,"" about driving on winding country roads. No overt political message at all, just a good song about an experience that anyone can identify with. You could imagine a fan of Stan Rogers getting into this; Jenny Bice's violin almost gives it a Maritime feeling. It's interesting that Hannah follows this song, with its images of freedom and release, with one of the grimmest of his prison songs, ""The Madness,""about being locked up in prison, wanting to ""just get one phone call"" to the outside world and not being allowed. It's a hell of a note to end the album on, actually; you don't expect him to let grimness prevail.</p> <p>There's probably no one person out there who is the perfect listener for the range of emotions and ideas contained on Coming Home. It's an intimate, honest album, drawing on a unique and complex life. Still, it's rewarding and interesting, and anyone who cares about the Subhumans (Canada), who is interested in politically motiviated or introspective folk music; or anyone who has spent time in prison - especially for activist-related activities - or who knows and likes Gerry Hannah's writings and songs should give it a listen. Not many albums like this one will ever exist.</p> <p>Now if maybe someone could put out a limited vinyl edition of Songs From Underground ...</p> <p>(Note: see Gerry Hannah's bandcamp here , or read his recently re-vamped blog here . You can also attempt to friend him on Facebook , which he only just joined a few weeks ago - though he ask that you send him a message letting him know who you are and why you want to friend him. He's a bit ambivalent about social media, as you might imagine).</p> <p>comments powered by</p>","Yes"

This is his story...</p> <p>Adam Parrish Wainwright</p> <p>was born on August 30, 1981, in Brunswick, Georgia. (Click</p> <p>here for today's sports birthdays.) He had one brother,</p> <p>Trey, who was seven years his senior. Adam's parents had a rocky</p> <p>marriage, and they split up when he was around seven years old. After</p> <p>the divorce, his mother, Nancy, became a real estate agent and raised</p> <p>the boys on her own. Adam's father, Bill, eventually moved to Florida,</p> <p>but stayed a part of his sons's lives. They grew to be extremely self-sufficient,</p> <p>with excellent work ethics.</p> <p>Trey became Adam's</p> <p>de facto father and baseball coach, with an assist from the baseball dads</p> <p>who helped coach his youth league teams. Trey built a pitcher's</p> <p>mound in the backyard, and tutored his little brother on the correct mechanics.</p> <p>When Trey had a ball game of his own, Adam accompanied him. When he went</p> <p>looking for a pickup game, Adam tagged along, often joining as a spare</p> <p>player when they were short.</p> <p>With</p> <p>the Braves playing nearby, Adam dreamed of pitching for Atlanta one day.</p> <p>He began mowing down Little Leaguers at the same time the Braves were</p> <p>building their pitching staff in the early 1990s, with Tom Glavine, John</p> <p>Smoltz, Steve Avery and, later, Greg Maddux. After losing the World Series</p> <p>in 1991 and 1992, the Braves finally won it all in 1995. Adam now upped</p> <p>the ante--he wanted to be on the mound for Atlanta when the club</p> <p>claimed another World Series title.</p> <p>For a while, it looked</p> <p>like Adam's future might be as a football player. He was strong,</p> <p>fast and well-coordinated. Adam made the varsity after enrolling at Glynn</p> <p>Academy in nearby Brunswick, and was named All-State as a receiver in</p> <p>his junior and senior years. He was also an All-Region placekicker.</p> <p>As Adam sprouted to</p> <p>6-5 in high school and learned how to harness his 90-mph fastball and</p> <p>over-the-top curve, it became clear that his greatest potential lied on</p> <p>the mound, not the gridiron. Not that he was bad hitter--Adam batted</p> <p>over .500 twice for Glynn. In 2000, he was named Gatorade's Player</p> <p>of the Year for Georgia. Georgia Tech offered him a full ride and he signed</p> <p>a letter of intent, with the understanding he might go pro under the right</p> <p>set of circumstances.</p> <p>In preparation for</p> <p>the next step in Adam's sports career, Trey enrolled in law school</p> <p>and interned for a sports agent. As the draft approached, he and Adam</p> <p>told every team that he planned to play ball for Georgia Tech--everyone,</p> <p>that is, except the Braves. Having successfully scared off Atlanta's</p> <p>competitors, the Wainwrights waited for the phone call, and got it. Atlanta</p> <p>selected him with its top pick.</p> <p>It took only two days</p> <p>to hammer out a contract, and then Adam was off to the Braves' rookie</p> <p>team in the Gulf Coast league. There he started five games and went 4-0,</p> <p>before a promotion to Danville of the Appalachian League. For the Class-A</p> <p>Braves, he split four decisions. In 2001, Adam, who now stood 6-7, pitched</p> <p>for Macon of the South Atlantic League and broke Bruce Chen's team</p> <p>record for strikeouts with 184. He was named the Braves' best minor</p> <p>league pitching prospect.</p> <p>In</p> <p>2002, Adam moved up to Myrtle beach of the Carolina League, where he fanned</p> <p>167 batters in 163 innings while surrendering a mere seven home runs.</p> <p>He was tabbed for the Futures Game in Milwaukee and pitched a scoreless</p> <p>inning for the U. S. team.</p> <p>Adam conintued his</p> <p>climb through the Atlanta farm system in 2003, as he joined the Class-AA</p> <p>Greeneville Braves. In 27 starts, Adam fashioned a 10-8 record, walking</p> <p>just 37 batters, while striking out 128. He was particularly strong down</p> <p>the stretch, going 4-1 with a 2.06 ERA in the final month.</p> <p>In the fall of 2003,</p> <p>Adam joined a group of hopefuls on Team USA to prepare for the Olympic</p> <p>qualifying tournament in Mexico. He pitched so poorly against Arizona</p> <p>Fall League competition, however, that Dave Stewart cut him. The 1989</p> <p>World Series MVP told Adam that he had the ability to be a great pitcher,</p> <p>but needed to believe that himself before he could achieve his potential.</p> <p>Adam thought a lot about Stewart's advice during the off-season.</p> <p>And a busy off-season</p> <p>it was. In December of 2003, Adam decided to propose to his girlfriend,</p> <p>Jenny. As he was trying to pop the question, his mother kept interupting</p> <p>him with phone calls.

The Cardinals swept San Diego to set up a showdown with the pitching</p> <p>depleted Mets.

New York</p> <p>took Game Six, and Game Seven was a classic, with great pitching and fielding.</p> <p>Yadier Molina blasted a two-run homer in the top of the ninth to give</p> <p>St. Louis a 3-1 lead, and La Russa called Adam in to finish off the Mets.</p> <p>It would not be easy.</p> <p>Jose Valentin and</p> <p>Endy Chavez singled to start the inning, which meant every batter who</p> <p>stepped into the box against Adam represented the pennant-winning run.</p> <p>Instead of bunting the runners over, Willie Randolph hoped to catch lightning</p> <p>in a bottle and sent Cliff Floyd up to pinch hit. Adam got him keyed up</p> <p>for a two-strike heater and dropped in a curve for strike three. Jose</p> <p>Reyes lined to center for the second out, and with the Shea Stadium crowd</p> <p>louder than ever, Adam snapped off an 0-2 curve that froze Carlos Beltran</p> <p>and floated into Molina's glove for a called third strike.</p> <p>The surprising Cardinals</p> <p>faced the equally surprising Tigers in the World Series. Detroit was favored</p> <p>because of its young flamethrowers. But with the exception of their rookie</p> <p>closer, the Cardinals had experience on their side.</p> <p>The Cardinals won</p> <p>Games One and Three easily, while the Tigers took Game Two behind Kenny</p> <p>Rogers. In Game Four, Adam came on in the eighth and gave up a game-tying</p> <p>double to Brandon Inge. After composing himself, he blew a two-strike</p> <p>fastball past Alexis Gomez and buckled Curtis Granderson's knees</p> <p>with a perfect 3-2 curve to extinguish Detroit's last good rally.</p> <p>In the ninth, after Eckstein doubled home the go-ahead run for St. Louis,</p> <p>Adam retired the Tigers 1-2-3 to pick up the victory and put St. Louis</p> <p>one victory away from the championship.</p> <p>In Game Five, Adam</p> <p>faced Inge again with two out in the ninth and struck him out for the</p> <p>title. In all, he worked 9.2 innings in the postseason and did not allow</p> <p>an earned run after September 26. He recorded four saves and one win in</p> <p>the playoffs and World Series.</p> <p>Despite Adam's</p> <p>stellar stint as a closer, the Cardinals insist that he will be in their</p> <p>2007 starting rotation--much like Jonathan Papelbon of the Boston</p> <p>Red Sox. The two, however, are not alike. While Papelbon has a history</p> <p>of being erratic, Adam has great command of his entire pitching repertoire</p> <p>and his mechanics are impeccable. In other words, whether he's a starter</p> <p>or closer, Adam will be a handful for opposing hitters.</p> <p>A</p> <p>number of factors went into the decision to make Adam the Cardinals'</p> <p>closer in September of 2006. One that is often overlooked is how quick</p> <p>he gets ready, and how easily he bounces back from an outing the next</p> <p>day--unusual qualities for a lifelong starter. Tony La Russa noticed</p> <p>this in spring training, and it tilted in Adam's favor after the</p> <p>St. Louis skipper chose to keep Braden Looper in a setup role.</p> <p>Adam attacks hitters.</p> <p>He doesn't like to mess around. He will throw a 94-mph heater around</p> <p>the fringes of the strike zone, and is not afraid to use his overhand</p> <p>curve on fastball counts. He also has an improving changeup. Adam uses</p> <p>his height to maximum advantage, changing delivery planes on hitters.</p> <p>Although it may be</p> <p>tempting to keep Adam in a closing role, he is ideally suited to starting.</p> <p>It is likely that Adam will team with Cris Carpenter to give the Cardinals</p> <p>the one-two punch they had envisioned when signing Mark Mulder in 2005.</p>","Yes"

To contribute your thoughts on the PPV, click here or email us at pwtorch@gmail.com.</p> <p>TNA's anniversary PPV recognizing 10 years in business opened with a video package documenting the origins of TNA. Jeff Jarrett was focused on, then Kurt Angle's big TNA debut mid-way through company history, then Hulk Hogan and The Outsiders, X Division big moments, Angle and Samoa Joe back when Joe had BA status, Elix Skipper's walk-the-cage huracanrana voted the Top Moment in TNA history by PWTorch readers, the president of the company marking out for Hulkamania, Impact from England, and now Bobby Roode as TNA Champion.</p> <p>Live from Arlington, Mike Tenay introduced the show as TNA picked up crowd shots and showed one side of the arena full to the balcony. The set-up looks major leagues. To begin the PPV, Hulk Hogan's music played. Out came Hogan to a star reaction and he played to the crowd on-stage. Hogan then slowly made his way down the entrance ramp to the ring as TNA went to a wideshot of the arena. Taz chimed in that there's a lot of energy in the building tonight.</p> <p>Once in the ring, Hogan warmed himself up before doing the cup-the-ear routine trying to get the crowd warmed up. Hogan continued to stretch out his promo time before welcoming everyone to Slammiversary, which he called a celebration of ten years. He said the next ten years is going to be twice as awesome. After pausing for some scattered chants, Hogan said TNA is ""shooting to the moon"" and things keep changing around here. He noted he likes pushing people's buttons, and the first button he's pushing tonight relates to the first match. Hogan announced the first match is going to be Samoa Joe vs. Austin Aries, and the button he's pushing is the match will be for the X Division Title.</p> <p>Hogan's music played, then he slowly made his way down the entrance ramp to a side exit. Enter Samoa Joe to challenge for the title. Joe stood on-stage and surveyed the crowd before making his way to the ring as Tenay noted Joe exceeds the divison's weight limit, but Hogan is changing things up tonight. Strong reaction for Joe before Austin Aries came out to defend.</p> <p>1 -- X Division champion AUSTIN ARIES vs. SAMOA JOE -- X Division Title match</p> <p>Once the bell sounded, both men acted fired up to open the PPV before locking up and exchanging holds. The two men felt each other out before Joe slapped Aries across the face, then Aries came back with strikes that Joe no-sold. Aries then dropped Joe to the outside with a head scissors, but Joe destroyed Aries, who attempted a suicide dive. Joe played to an appreciative crowd before chopping Aries back in the ring. Awesome first two minutes. Joe followed with a big corner kick before washing Aries's face with his boot. Joe followed with a corner boot that missed Aries, but Aries sold like it connected.</p> <p>Aries and Joe went back and forth countering each other's offense before resetting at 4:00. Another counter sequence saw Aries roll out of the way of an attempted elbow suicide dive before flying back into the ring to deliver a suicide dive to Joe back on the outside. ""Aust-in Aries / Let's Go Joe"" dueling chants picked up as the two men re-entered the ring with Aries in control. But, Joe countered a corner attack with a running sideslam for a close two count. Joe followed with knee lifts, then a sit-out powerbomb for a two count that he turned into a modified Boston Crab. Aries refused to tap, so Joe flowed into an STF mid-ring. Then, into a modified Rings of Saturn, which Aries countered into a quick roll-up for a two count.</p> <p>The two men reset at 7:15 with Joe collecting himself while Aries sold in the corner. Joe followed up with rapid-fire headbutts, then wanted a top-rope superplex, but Aries headbutted Joe down to the mat. Aries then executed a top-rope 450 splash, but Joe kicked out of a pin in-time. The crowd popped for the nearfall as Aries sold shock. The two men re-engaged by trading bombs from their knees as the crowd picked up a dueling chant. Joe then avoided a discus clothesline and slapped on a sleeperhold. Joe then fell down to the mat with a rear-naked choke, which Aries countered into a bridge pin for a close two count.</p> <p>Joe came back with a power throw out of the corner, then fired himself up. He wanted a top-rope Musclebuster, but Aries slipped out and landed elbow strikes into a sick crucifix throw. Aries followed with a running strike into a discus forearm smash that rocked Joe. Aries followed with a corner kick into the brainbuster center-ring. The crowd popped for Aries's feat of strength executing the brainbuster, then Aries made a cover for the pin and the win. Post-match: Taz said you won't find anything else more physical than that match in pro wrestling on PPV. They replayed high points from the match, then returned live to show Aries celebrating his victory as Joe sold the effects of the finish. Aries and Joe then came together center-ring and they fist-bumped as a show of respect. On the way, Aries said that's why he's the greatest.</p> <p>WINNER: Aries at 11:48 to retain the X Division Title. Excellent, excellent opening match. Just great from start to finish with a hot crowd behind the action. Aries was able to continue his quest of successfully defeating big-man wrestlers and Joe got some of his mojo back working with the perfect opponent. A little longer and the match easily would have been four stars. (***1/2)</p> <p>Exterior Shot: TNA showed footage of Arlington, Texas, home to the Cowboys and Rangers as the Texas flag fluttered in the breeze. Tenay thanked the audience for joining the PPV. Ringside: Tenay and Taz talked on-camera to reset the show following the opening match.</p> <p>Arena: Kid Kash made his return to TNA for a match against Hernandez added last-second after Impact. Hernandez then made his return sporting new facial hair and a slimmed-down frame returning in his homestate.</p> <p>2 -- HERNANDEZ vs. KID KASH</p> <p>Hernandez over-powered Kash early on before knocking him to the floor. Hernandez wanted to fly, but Kash walked away, as Taz equated Hernandez to Randy White of Cowboys fame. After dodging Hernandez's flying attack, Kash took control of the action back in the ring. Kash landed big chops to the chest to annoy Hernandez before executing some surprising high-flying offense on Hernandez that were borderline botches. Kash got cocky, though, and walked into a slingshot shoulder block from Hernandez.</p> <p>Hernandez made a comeback with power offense before flying over the top rope with a missile splash. Hernandez then brought Kash back into the ring for the finish. After avoiding some desperation offense from Kash, Hernandez set up Kash center-ring to deliver a big top-rope splash. (TNA cut to a great camera shot over Hernandez's head as he landed the splash.) Hernandez then scored the pin for the win.</p> <p>WINNER: Hernandez at 5:52. The chemistry was hit or miss throughout, and there was no back-story for why this match occurred, but a fine return for Hernandez. (*1/2)</p> <p>TNA Moment #3 video package: A. J. Styles becoming the first NWA-TNA X Division champion on June 19, 2002.</p> <p>Arena: Robbie E. and Rob Terry came to the ring sporting matching cardigans as Taz tried to make some references to what the people in the crowd are wearing. TV champ Devon and Garett Bischoff then came out as Garett did the young babyface deal of looking around the arena ""soaking up the moment"" with a breathless stare.</p> <p>3 -- TV champion DEVON & GARETT BISCHOFF vs. ROBBIE E. & ROB TERRY</p> <p>Robbie went after Garett early on, but Bischoff came back with some basic wrestling holds. Robbie then scampered over to his corner to tag in Terry. Bischoff ducked a clothesline, then tried some kicks and strikes, but Terry no-sold and shoved him away. Bischoff tried some offense, but Terry continued to fling him away. Suddenly, Madison Rayne emerged on-stage looking completely different. The heels then cornered Bischoff and worked him over as Devon waited for a tag. The crowd reacted when Devon broke up a pin attempt on Bischoff as Madison smiled on-stage.</p> <p>Bischoff eventually escaped Robbie and made a hot tag to Devon, who entered the match fired-up for his team. Devon cleared Robbie before knocking Robbie off the apron. Eventually, the match broke down with all four men in the ring. Bischoff then took Terry out of the ring, leaving Devon and Robbie in the ring. Devon then hit a big shoulder tackle on Robbie for the pin and the win. Post-match, Devon and Bischoff did a dance number before celebrating in the ring.</p> <p>WINNER: Devon & Robbie at 5:56. The crowd was into Devon, but not Bischoff. Okay tag match. (*1/4)</p> <p>Backstage: Jeremy Borash did a big build-up before bringing in special guests from the beginning of TNA. It was Daniels and Kazarian. Kaz said he was in the first-ever Ultimate X match and noted you always remember your first. Daniels, holding glasses of champagne, vowed to successfully defend the Tag Titles tonight, continue to expose A.J. Styles and Dixie Carter, and continue to be role models. Daniels took a sip, but didn't like the taste. JB then sent it back to the arena.</p> <p>Arena: Mr. Anderson's music played to bring out Anderson for the three-way #1 contender match. Anderson, sporting new short hair, stood on-stage and said there appear to be some a-holes in the building tonight. He asked the crowd if they just called him an a-hole before noting this a-hole hails from Green Bay, Wisconsin. After introducing himself twice, Anderson strutted to the ring. Rob Van Dam was out next as the crowd chanted along with Van Dam. Out last was Jeff Hardy, whose music the crowd did not recognize until he emerged on-stage. Hardy, sporting his trademark wild facepaint, took a victory lap around the ring, including getting WWE's Sign Guy on-camera, before entering the ring to start the match.</p> <p>4 -- JEFF HARDY vs. MR. ANDERSON vs. ROB VAN DAM -- #1 contender match to TNA World Title</p> <p>The match started on a random note with Hardy attacking Van Dam out of nowhere. Some three-way spots ensued, including Hardy running off Anderson's back as Anderson sold on the mat to land a corner leg smash on RVD. Next was a Tower of Doom tease, but Anderson broke it up by flinging RVD to the outside and super-plexing Hardy. Van Dam tried to follow with a Five-Star Frogsplash out of nowhere, but both men moved out of the way and RVD ate the mat.</p> <p>After a reset, all three men started landing moves on each other almost in video-game fashion without any flow. Someone needed to take control of the match. Van Dam slowed things down momentarily by working on his opponents one-by-one before they set up a three-way pin spot with dual nearfalls. Anderson came up the aggressor following the nearfalls and cleared RVD from the ring before scoring a nearfall on Hardy. Anderson then took the action to the outside, so Hardy decided to come off the top rope with a big splash onto both opponents.</p> <p>Hardy and RVD returned to the ring, where Hardy nailed Whisper in the Wind for a close two count. Hardy then hit Twist of Fate that appeared to cause some neck whiplash for RVD. Hardy wanted to end it with a top-rope Swanton Bomb, and he connected, but Anderson pulled the ref away from the pin count. Anderson then cleared Hardy from the ring, dropped RVD with the Mic Check, and pinned Van Dam for the win. Anderson gets a title shot against Roode-Sting on Impact in four days.</p> <p>WINNER: Anderson at 11:24 to become #1 contender. Good finish after some hit or miss three-way action in the tired three-way match formula. Anderson scoring the win was surprising, but a match-up against Roode or Sting feels the freshest out of the three individuals in the match. (**3/4)</p> <p>Backstage: JB brought in Crimson to discuss his Open Challenge. Crimson flashed his heelish grin and said it doesn't matter who accepts his Open Challenge because he will beat anyone. He put his big arm around JB and said no one will beat him.</p> <p>Arena: Crimson strutted out to the ring and recapped his Open Challenge to find an individual who can beat him. He said everything is bigger in Texas, and he's looking at the biggest drop of losers he's ever seen in his life. ""You Suck"" chant from the crowd before Crimson noted he came here to fight. He said he could fight a ""crappy Maverick,"" one of the Rangers, or even one of the ""damn Cowboys"" if he has to. No love for the Stars? Crimson then sat back to see if anyone accepts his challenge. As Crimson waited, a light ""Goldberg"" chant started up. Crimson continued to wait before James Storm's music played to bring out Storm returning after a two-month absence. Crimson flipped out and sold concern as Storm made his way to the ring.</p> <p>5 -- ""COWBOY"" JAMES STORM vs. CRIMSON -- Open Challenge</p> <p>Crimson tried to run at Storm once he hit the ring, but Storm blocked his attack and cleared Crimson to the outside. Storm continued to fight in his long jacket before slapping Crimson across the chest. Crimson then blind-sided Storm, who turned his back for a moment. Crimson ripped off Storm's jacket and choked him with it as the crowd chanted, ""Let's Go Cowboy(s)."" Storm then made his comeback, fired up the crowd, warmed up for a Last Call superkick, and connected. Storm with the pin for the win. And, Crimson's ""streak"" is over. Post-match, Storm celebrated with a beer as he soaked in the moment returning from his brief absence.</p> <p>WINNER: Storm at 2:10. Good return for Storm as he gets back in the title quest springboarding off this victory. (n/a)</p> <p>Backstage: JB brought in X Division champion Austin Aries to find out what's next for Aries. He said in less than one year, he's gone from a guy fighting for a contract to one of TNA's biggest stars. Aries said he's passed every test every month, and what he wants next is to be The Man. Quite simply, he wants to be the ""main event"" and will do whatever he has to do to get there. Foreshadowing for the Destination X PPV hype.</p> <p>TNA Moment #2 video package: October 2009 when Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff joined TNA and Dixie Carter.</p> <p>Arena: Back live, TNA president Dixie Carter's music played to bring out Carter all-smiles. Tenay thanked the Carter family for making the past ten years possible. In the ring, Dixie shouted out to DFW before saying this is a very surreal moment right now appearing in front of her family, friends, and largest TNA crowd in the U.S. She said there are a lot of people to thank including her parents, the Jarretts, and Spike TV. More importantly, to the wrestling fans who have supported TNA. She said they love the word ""wrestling"" and she hopes they are having a good time tonight. Dixie thanked every wrestler who has set foot in this ring and hyped the current roster. She then asked everyone to come out on-stage.</p> <p>A.J. Styles led the group out as heels and faces tried to maintain character. Taz noted Styles was the first one out, playing up Dixie's and Styles's ""photo scandal"" storyline. Daniels and Kazarian filed in behind the rest of the group before Hogan came out last. Crimson continued to sell his loss as Sting was shown. Dixie thanked everyone for being part of TNA, then said she would like to introduce the first TNA Hall of Fame inductee. Dixie rolled video from June 18, 2003 when Sting debuted in TNA during the Wednesday Night PPV Era. Hogan, Joe, Aries, Angle, Styles, Crimson, and Devon talked in sit-down soundbytes about Sting as TNA showed highlights of Sting in TNA. As the video continued to play, they cut back live to show Sting watching the video on the entrance ramp.</p> <p>After the video ended, they cut back to show Sting almost no-selling the video before his music played. Sting appeared to be fighting back tears while trying to downplay the announcement - almost appearing to be embarrassed by the attention - before entering the ring to walk around next to Dixie Carter. Dixie and Sting hugged before Dixie introduced Sting to the crowd.</p> <p>Dixie said when TNA was a ""small, struggling company,"" they needed an ""icon"" like Sting. Dixie said Sting said he would come in and help them for a while, but he continued to come back year after year (to a big payday). Dixie said she thinks Sting is doing his finest work, then announced they will have a formal introduction at Bound for Glory later this year. ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" and ""Thank you, Sting"" chants greeted Sting. Sting said he was not prepared for this because he just came here to wrestle. Sting thanked the men and women on the roster, the crowd, and Dixie, then noted it will be ""Showtime"" tonight in the TNA World Title match. Sting's music played to end the announcement segment. Announcers: Tenay and Taz were shown on-camera talking up Sting. Taz claimed no one knew who was going to be inducted, then heaped praise on Sting for his contributions to TNA.</p> <p>6 -- Knockouts champion GAIL KIM vs. MISS TESSMACHER -- Knockouts Title match</p> <p>Miss Tessmacher, introduced as hailing ""from the great State of Texas,"" came out next to challenge for the Knockouts Title. KO champ Gail Kim then came out to make her latest title defense. Back-and-forth early on before Gail dropped Tessmacher hard on the ropes to begin a sustained attack. Gail then got cocky when she continued to cut off Tessmacher's comebacks, which ultimately led to her demise when Tessmacher suddenly rolled up Gail out of nowhere for a quick three count. Tessmacher sold the moment as her hand was raised, while Gail sold shock over the sudden loss. Ringside: Christy Hemme brought in Tessmacher for an instant reaction to the title win. She called her win ""truly epic"" and proclaimed, ""God Bless Texas.""</p> <p>WINNER: Tessmacher at 7:01 to capture KO Title. As Tenay foreshadowed, the ""homestate advantage"" storyline played out to end Gail's lengthy title run dating back to November 2011.</p> <p>Backstage: JB tried to talk up social media before Bully Ray covered JB's mouth and introduced himself from New York to boos. He said he has Joseph Park right where he wants him. Ray pulled out his contract to remind Park that he will not be responsible for any damage inflicted on Park tonight. As for Abyss, Park said perhaps he did not leave Abyss for dead, but if Abyss shows up tonight, he will not be wrong twice.</p> <p>Arena: Bully Ray came out first for the grudge match before Joseph Park emerged sans music. Park was sporting an Under Armour track suit as he sold that his stomach was in his throat having to face Ray in an unfamiliar environment. A ""Yankees Suck"" chant started up as Park made his way around the ring avoiding entering the ring. This was followed by a ""Let's Go Rangers"" chant. Park waited out the chants before struggling to enter the ring.</p> <p>7 -- BULLY RAY vs. JOSEPH PARK -- Anything Goes Match</p> <p>Park, still sporting glasses, wiped his forehead with a towel before slowly approaching Ray, who offered the first shot. Park then took off his glasses and re-approached Ray. Park swung and missed Ray, who easily ducked out of the way before asking Park if he's serious. Ray then slapped Park across the face before offering his chin again. Ray ducked two punches, then slapped Park across the top of his head.</p> <p>Next, Ray offered to put his hands behind his back. Park took a loogie in the eye, then slaps to the face as Ray called him a coward. ""Joseph, Joseph"" chant from the crowd. Park then slapped Ray across the face to a big reaction after Ray missed with a corner attack. But, Park made TNA Babyface Mistake #1 turning to the hard camera to celebrate, prompting Ray to blind-side him. Park sold on the mat before Ray went on the attack to boos. The crowd then tried to get at Ray with a ""New York sucks"" chant, prompting Taz to wonder what happened to Southern hospitality. Ray retrieved a chair, but fell on the mat when Park kicked the ropes (because of the vibrations ). Park slowly picked up the chair, Ray begged off, Park turned his back, and Ray attacked him again.</p> <p>Ray went on a sustained attack, including a chair shot across the back. On the outside, Ray teed off on Park with right hand strikes while he taunted the crowd. Back in the ring, Ray went for a butt bomb from the second rope, but Park avoided, then Hulked Up. Park fired off lefts and rights before Ray covered up. Park blew himself up, which Taz noted, before the two men kind of collided center-ring in a weird spot. Park then turned around and ate a boot to the face from Ray.</p> <p>Ray turned his attention to a table underneath the ring, which Ray slid into the ring. Ray then pulled out a Kendo Stick and threatened ref Earl Hebner before setting up the table in the ring. A light ""ECW"" chant started up as Ray set up shop center-ring. Ray went for a Kendo Stick shot, but Park hit him in the gut with a lucky punch. Park then caned Ray across the head and kind of dove on top of Ray for a close two count. Park spit up drool before surveying the table in the ring. Park charged Ray, who elbowed Park in the face to knock him to the outside.</p> <p>Park then rolled underneath the ring, disappearing from sight. Suddenly, Abyss emerged. They didn't show his face, and just focused on his trademark get-up from behind. Ray turned around, sold shock, and Abyss landed a chokeslam through the table. Abyss slid back underneath the ring, then Joseph Park re-emerged, selling that he did not know what was going on. Park then stumbled into the ring and covered a KO'ed Ray for the pin and the win. After the win, Park continued to sell shock as the announcers talked about how weird that was.</p> <p>WINNER: Park/Abyss at 10:23. Well, that was...something. Ray was solid in his heel role walking the crowd through this odd match. But, the crowd didn't exactly play along with TNA trying to pull a fast one with the Abyss/Park switcheroo at the end.</p> <p>Backstage: JB brought in TNA World Hvt. champion Bobby Roode to discuss his latest TNA Title defense against Sting tonight. Roode said he doesn't give a crap about Sting's Hall of Fame induction because the only thing people will remember from tonight is him ending Sting's career and leaving as still World Hvt. champion.</p> <p>Arena: Hulk Hogan's music played again. Hogan stood on-stage and asked the crowd to give it up for Joseph Park and Slammiversary. He then noted he has one more surprise for everyone tonight. He introduced Christian Cage, the current WWE Intercontinental champion. The crowd popped for Christian being announced, then Christian walked out on-stage and shook hands with Hogan. Christian, dressed in a white dress shirt and jeans, slowly made his way down to the ring for this historic moment of a current WWE wrestler appearing at a TNA event. Taz said he's shocked to see Christian here tonight.</p> <p>Once in the ring, Christian surveyed the audience before grabbing a mic. ""Welcome Back"" chant from the crowd. Christian paused to look around the arena before noting the question he's been asked the most this week is whether the rumors are true that he will be appearing at Slammiversary this Sunday. ""Drink it in,"" he said before the crowd chanted, ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" He said it's indeed true that Christian Cage is standing right here in a TNA ring. He then pointed out that the last time he was here, there was a six-sided ring. Christian said things may have changed since he was last in TNA, but the fans have remained the same. He said the fans that allowed TNA to be in existence for ten years and beyond is worth a round of applause.</p> <p>Christian said he's been asked to be here tonight to introduce the #1 moment in TNA history. Video rolled of the #1 moment being January 15, 2006 when Sting returned to TNA to confront Jeff Jarrett. Hey, there's Monty Brown. Christian was also involved. And, that was that for Christian, as TNA suddenly cut to a video package on the Tag Title feud. (There was no mention of WWE during Christian's appearance.)</p> <p>Arena: As tag champs Daniels and Kazarian came out to defend the Tag Titles, Taz noted he doesn't keep up with TNA president Dixie Carter's tweets, so he was not aware of Christian returning tonight. Taz continued to present a defense for not being prepared because he shares the Internet at home. Kurt angle, then A.J. Styles came out to challenge for the Tag Titles. As he should, Styles ran into the ring to attack Daniels and Kaz due to the ""personal"" grudge-feud nature of their feud.</p> <p>8 -- TNA tag champions CHRISTOPHER DANIELS & KAZARIAN vs. KURT ANGLE & A.J. STYLES -- TNA Tag Title match</p> <p>Daniels and Kaz cut off Styles once the bell sounded, then Styles engaged in a wrestling exchange with Kaz to clear him from the ring. The action then moved to the floor, where Styles nailed a high-flying move on Kaz. Angle then smashed Daniels on the outside, but it was out of camera view. Back in the ring, Styles tagged in Angle to a pop. Angle then went to work on the heels before tagging in Styles, who went back-and-forth with Kaz before Daniels provided a distraction. Kaz and Daniels then went to work on Styles as Angle paced on the ring apron.</p> <p>Angle eventually tagged in at 8:00 and went nuts on Kaz and Daniels with suplexes and throws. Angle then set up for successive German Suplexes on Kaz, and used an assist from Styles to deliver a double third German on Kaz and Daniels. Angle then slapped on the Anklelock to Daniels, but Kaz broke it up. Styles and Kaz then tagged into the match, and Styles cleaned house. Angle then re-entered and all four men were involved at this point.</p> <p>A series of sequences customary for a four-way match occurred before Styles and Daniels came together center-ring to trade headbutts and strikes. Daniels then landed an STO and wanted the BME, but Styles moved and Angle dropped Daniels with a German Suplex. Angle then went up top and landed a frogsplash on Kaz. He had the pin, but Daniels yanked the ref out of the ring. Styles then nailed Daniels on the outside with a springboard gainer splash. Back in the ring, Angle grappled Kaz and slapped on the Anklelock. Angle grapevined it, Kaz reached for the ropes, and reached again, but he had to tap out, giving Angle and Styles the title win. Ringside, Styles sold that he was stunned to have won as Angle kissed the mat to celebrate victory. They replayed big moments from the match before returning live to show the new tag champs getting their hands raised in victory.</p> <p>WINNERS: Angle & Styles at 14:23 to capture the TNA Tag Titles. This looks like the ""feel good moment"" before the main event with a likely Roode PPV Finish. Solid semi-main event match. Angle and Styles are better as singles wrestlers, but they were still good here. (**3/4)</p> <p>Announcers: Tenay and Taz talked about the Tag Title match, then transitioned to focusing on the TNA World Title main event. A video package documented the build-up to Roode vs. Sting before TNA returned to the announcers to break down the Tale of the Tape and Bullet Points on the main event.</p> <p>Arena: Sting's music played to bring out the main event challenger first. Once Sting entered the ring, Bobby Roode's slow, dramatic music played to bring out Roode on-stage wearing a robe customary for someone who considers himself a top star. Roode slowly strutted down to the ring as he looked around the arena to sneer at the crowd. Roode then entered the ring and walked past Sting to pose on the top turnbuckle as TNA went to an overhead camera shot. JB then handled formal ring intros for the main event. Awesome how JB said Sting weighed in at a certain weight ""this morning,"" suggesting there was an actual weigh-in for the main event to create more of a sports feel. After formal ring intros, Roode bailed to the outside and continued to stall before finally entering the ring to start the match.</p> <p>9 -- TNA World Hvt. champion BOBBY ROODE vs. STING -- TNA World Title match</p> <p>Once the bell sounded, Roode slipped to the outside again to continue stalling. Sting then trapped him on the floor and ran Roode into the guardrail. Back in the ring, Sting landed successive blows to the mid-section, then face before hip-tossing Roode across the ring. Sting tried a second Scorpion Deathlock, but Roode slipped to the outside again. Sting tracked down Roode again and ran him into the ring steps this time. Roode eventually trapped Sting playing his cat & mouse game, and went on the attack. The crowd tried to rally behind Sting, who escaped a sleeperhold before slapping on a sleeperhold of his own. Roode back-dropped out of the hold, though, and both men sold on the mat.</p> <p>Roode and Sting reset at 7:00 before the match moved to the top turnbuckle. Sting blocked Roode, then delivered a superplex. He wanted the Scorpion again, applied the hold, and sat down on Roode's back. Roode teased tapping out a few times, but reached the bottom rope for a desperation break. Roode quickly slipped out of the ring to sell the back before Sting ran him into the guardrail on the floor. Roode tried to run away to the back, but Sting dragged Roode down the ramp and back into the ring.</p> <p>Once in the ring, Roode rolled out of the ring, where Sting met him with a Stinger Splash into the guardrail. The action moved to the broadcast table and the announcers cleared out while So Cal Val crawled away out of harm's way. Sting then slapped on the Scorpion Deathlock on the announce table, and Roode tapped out, but the ref noted to Sting that it has to be inside the ring. Sting released the hold, thinking he won the match.</p> <p>During the confusion, Roode retrieved James Storm's left-over six-pack of beer. No one thought to remove it from ringside? Roode teased a bottle shot, but Sting stole it. The ref then took it away from Sting, but Roode pulled out another beer bottle and popped Sting across the forehead with it. The bottle didn't shatter like a gimmicked bottle, but broke into a few pieces. Roode then made a cover, the ref re-entered the ring and ignored the broken bottle in standard TNA Incompetent Refereeing fashion, and counted a three count for Roode. The crowd booed the finish.</p> <p>WINNER: Roode at 10:54 to retain the TNA World Title. A typical TNA PPV main event with a tricks and short-cuts to get through a serviceable main event. If TNA wants to take the next step, improving their PPV main events is a Top 5 item to address. (**)</p> <p>Post-match: Sting immediately stood up behind Roode and stalked the champ from behind. Sting, with blood on his forehead from the bottle shot, approached Roode and clotheslined him over the top rope before clotheslining the ref to a pop. Sting then dragged Roode up the entrance ramp to the stage, where he delivered a suplex. Next, Sting took Roode to the edge of the stage and delivered a Scorpion Death Drop off the stage through a gimmicked crash set below. Sting held his head, then stood up and fired up the crowd as his music played. Tenay said Roode escaped with the title again, but Sting got the last word. Tenay plugged Roode vs. Anderson for the TNA Title this Thursday on Impact as Sting walked around the arena. Sting then re-entered the ring as medics checked on Roode near the stage. TNA signed off nine minutes before the top of the hour with Sting standing tall after the main event loss.</p> <p>FINAL THOUGHTS: Thumbs Up PPV. Not a strong Thumbs Up, but a solid Thumbs Up. If you came in with healthy expectations and knew what to expect from the main event, then you shouldn't walk away disappointed from this show. What will be interesting is whether people remember this PPV more for a WWE wrestler appearing on the show or anything else that occurred. Austin Aries vs. Samoa Joe opening the PPV and perhaps James Storm's return will give Christian a run for his money in the memorable department, but with so many stars at the same level and with TNA giving away so many star vs. star matches on Impact (similar to WWE on Raw and Smackdown), a lot of these matches will just blend into the collective memory.</p> <p>We suggest these recent related articles...</p> <p>CALDWELL'S TNA SLAMMIVERSARY PPV RESULTS 6/28: Complete ""virtual-time"" coverage of live PPV from Orlando - King of the Mountain match, Storm vs. Magnus, more</p> <p>KYGHT'S PPV EVALUATION - TNA Bound for Glory: Best/Worst Match, What Will Be Remembered?, Updated 2014 Rankings</p> <p>CLICK HERE FOR EVEN MORE PW.NET HEADLINES</p> <p>CLICK TO EMAIL THIS ARTICLE</p> <p>CLICK HERE TO RETURN TO MAIN LISTING</p>","Yes"

He hoped this at least would give him a head-start if he had to run for his life. 'When the Kurds came for me, I didn't know if they were IS and they were going to kidnap me. And I was going on the word of my hotel reception guy,' he said.</p> <p>Thankfully, the welcome party was genuine and Enright was taken on a hazardous three-day journey in the back of a truck across mountains and rocky dirt track roads, before crossing the mighty Tigris river in a rubber dinghy.</p> <p>Once he had reached a secret location, stationed alongside around 30 other white Westerners who had joined the YPG, Enright's basic training began.</p> <p>Apart from endless weapons drills and some rudimentary language classes, there was physical training, which he described as 'running up and down hills, basically'.</p> <p>To his surprise, having trained with hundreds of Kurdish fighters at the camp, he found he was something of a crack-shot, despite only ever previously handling a gun once at a shooting range in America on the eve of his departure.</p> <p>Up to now, while he awaits a major YPG offensive against IS, his most dangerous mission has been doing sentry duty on the frontline, often being woken at 2am to stand guard until daylight.</p> <p>He spent almost a month on the frontline, guarding one of the border areas of YPG territory, with IS fighters only a few hundred yards away. He said the likelihood of an IS night-raid or a deadly round from a sniper is always high.</p> <p>He explained: 'When you're on guard duty, you know the only thing between civilisation and Islamic State is you and your Kalashnikov.</p> <p>'You stay out of sight. You want to be able to see them, but you don't want them to see you.'</p> <p>He has witnessed coalition fighter jets flying over the YPG bases and firing at IS fighters.</p> <p>He said: 'When the aircraft come over your head, and they fire, it is the most incredibly, wild, bewildering sound that you've ever heard. And it's the loudest noise that you've ever heard in your life.'</p> <p>Then he hinted that things were about to get more serious. 'Where I'm going in the next two days, say a prayer for me, because I'll be going to a place which has a lot of action, a lot of fighting.'</p> <p>Enright is angry that Britain is not bombing IS targets in Syria, concentrating instead on Iraq. He said if there were more air raids against IS, then the terror group could be defeated in months. He said: 'We're out gunned, and we're out manned. We need the air support.'</p> <p>He says he has no plans to return to the US or Britain any time soon, Asked if he misses home, Enright said: 'No, I'm very happy to be here, to be doing something that I think will outlast me.'</p>","Yes"

The Scot's 36th minute goal settled a low-quality Championship clash with Blackpool, who are managed by former Blues boss Lee Clark.

We'll pause as you absorb how long you've been without Jed Bartlet and his merry band in your life. Doesn't it feel like just yesterday we all fell in love with Aaron Sorkin's bastion of liberal idealism wrapped up in fast-paced dialogue usually said while walking?The years since haven't been as kind to Sorkin's TV projects, as Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip bombed and The Newsroom continues to be a hate-watch target. (He did, of course, win an Oscar for writing The Social Network, because an Oscar is way cooler than your approval.) But what those shows lack that The West Wing had in spades was a collection of well-written, heart-infused characters. These were the kind of people you wanted to know in your own life. They could make you feel inspired about politics in our nation's worst moments of cynicism. Simply put, it was one of the best TV ensembles ever. As we rapidly approach major milestones for a lot of significant and spectacular shows, we've been preparing something special for you. We'll show you more next week, but as a little preview, we're honoring the characters of The West Wing with our signature definitive ranking. Which women and men do we still miss 15 years later? Which characters made us ask ""who?"" when writing this? Join us as we remember and rank 114 characters from the series.</p> <p>NOTE: Only characters who appeared in two or more episodes were eligible for this list ... with some exceptions. We left ourselves a few one-shot wild cards, because what would this list be without the Lionel Tribbeys or Evelyn Baker Langs of the show?One of the great mysteries of Hollywood--nay, of life--is that Aaron Sorkin is a fairly condescending and certainly problematic writer of women. And yet so goes C. J. She's not immune to Sorkin's missteps. Her entire backstory as a Hollywood publicist who doesn't seem to know much about Hollywood or publicity never made one lick of sense. And in the early seasons, she was the White House staffer most prone to making mistakes on the job. But her capability and combination of strength and simple compassion represented the fantasy of the Bartlet White House better than anyone. And have you seen her pull off ""The Jackal""?--JRSignature Episode: The ""Manchester"" two-parter that kicks off season three features C.J. at her lowest, after she completely blunders the press-briefing that follows Bartlet's MS announcement/military action in Haiti. We see her really struggle, but she gathers her backbone and has a great come-to-Jesus moment with Jed.The initial plan for President Bartlet was to pop in every few episodes for a quick scene here and there - The West Wing was meant to focus on the staff instead. He went on to appear in almost every episode in the series, entirely because of how incredible the character Sorkin and Sheen created together was. Bartlet wasn't a phantom figurehead; he was inspiring, frustrating, flawed, genius, courageous, and paternal. He's remembered as one of the greatest fictional presidents, and deservedly so. We dream of a real commander in chief who was half the president Bartlet was. - KOSignature Episode: ""Two Cathedrals,"" the second season finale wherein Bartlet mourns his late secretary and friend, curses at God in Latin, and defiantly tells the world he has multiple sclerosis. It's bravado work from Sheen, and he sells it at every turn.In the early, best seasons of The West Wing, when the show was about how furiously the protagonists had to struggle to achieve any kind of change, Toby Ziegler represented a crucial component, a misanthropic idealist whose grumbling rage masks an irrepressible desire to do what's right. Toby was simultaneously the most and least optimistic senior advisor to Bartlet, functioning as his better angel but also his worst critic. The character suffered in later seasons, particularly once Sorkin left, and Schiff himself complained about the leak storyline he was handed in season seven, which never jibed with the character he helped conceive. But in those early seasons, I lived to watch Ziegler go nose-to-nose with the President and challenge his pragmatism. - DS</p> <p>Signature Episode: First season episode ""In Excelsis Deo,"" which won Schiff the Emmy, sees Toby using his political clout to arrange a military burial for a homeless man he didn't even know; an honorable blip in a larger world of injustice he can only vainly struggle to fix. To pretty much all the central characters of the show, Leo is the heart, and certainly the father figure. Twinkle-eyed, funny, ruthlessly smart and stabilizing in the advise he gives everyone, he's an important stabilizing force in those early episodes before Sorkin quickly starts deconstructing him and his substance abuse problems. Of course, that only makes him more lovable as the other characters rush fiercely to his defense. Leo's purpose becomes a little muddled in later seasons as the characters kinda outgrow him (especially once he's not Chief of Staff) but the impact of Spencer's death near the end of season seven, which was written into the show, could not feel more devastating. - DSSignature Episode: The third season's ""Bartlet for America"" flashes back to Leo encouraging Bartlet to run for President and taps into everything inspirational and heartwarming and gritty about the character. Started out as a lobbyist for feminist groups; eventually served as a sometimes advisor to the Bartlet administration and later as the First Lady's chief of staff. I tend to be very accommodating to other points of view, and I am hardly ever a ""shipper"" for the shows that I watch, but if you preferred Josh and Donna to Josh and Amy, you are wrong. (Unless your rationale is that Josh and Donna are both kinda sucky and deserve each other, in which case: I'll allow it.) The simple truth of the matter is that Amy Gardner is not only a superior character to Donna, but she is much better suited to Josh. Their chemistry was off the charts, their political maneuverings gave fire to season three, and she gave as good as she got and pushed Josh to do the same. I pine for the apocryphal eighth season of The West Wing for many reasons, but none more than because Amy signed on to the Santos administration. - JRSignature Episode: Season four's ""Privateers,"" a.k.a. Amy's first day on the job as Abbey Bartley's chief of staff, during which, among other political maneuverings, she had to put up with this foolishness:You can feel Abbey Bartlet's passion about everything from the proud tremor in her voice to her knock-down, drag-out fights with her husband. She's a fiery First Lady not content to sit on the sidelines, but her desire to help her husband with his illness almost seals both of their fates. She cares deeply about her family - to a fault in multiple cases - and never let people push her around. For a woman in a Sorkin show to be so fierce and unique is a rarity, and a massive credit to Channing's portrayal. - KO</p> <p>Signature Episode: The correct answer is ""Dead Irish Writers,"" from season 3. Abbey's birthday party coincides with the potential loss of her medical license, and she gets a ton to do. But though the episode on the whole isn't hers, her scene with Jed in ""Bartlet's Third State of the Union"" is her most electric work from throughout the series. Margaret is the definition of a supporting player: always around, never too directly affecting the plot but always facilitating it. She has great moments (forging the president's signature stands out), is supposedly a compendium of human knowledge pre-Wikipedia, and remains incredibly loyal to both of her bosses - Leo til his death, and C. J. until they leave the White House. Even when her stories took strange turns (remember when she got pregnant and then it was never mentioned again? ), she remained a delight. - KOSignature Episode: ""Liftoff,"" the season six episode where C.J. starts as chief of staff. Margaret proves to be an invaluable resource to her new boss, and C.J. thanks her in kind. (Plus, she's tall, and C.J. likes that. )If you don't love every single second of Nancy McNally on The West Wing, just what exactly is your problem? She's tough, she's smart, she has a way of advancing her agenda as Bartlet's National Security Advisor, while remaining unwavering in her support of the administration. Anna Deavere Smith imbues her with so much inner strength and outer gravitas, it's easy to think she was a far bigger part of the series than she was. She should have been. - JRSignature Episode: I was tempted to go with ""The Women of Qumar,"" when she talks C.J. down off a ledge, but that episode's a little pitched for my taste. I don't much care for season two's ""Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail"" either, but that one features Nancy giving Sam the high hand like you would not believe as she walks him through what he knows versus what he thinks he knows about a classified spy case. Charlie starts out a bit of a cypher--added in the third episode partly to address concerns that the main cast was entirely white, Charlie is the President's personal aide and a lot of his early material is just friendly bantering with Bartlet as he follows him around. But Hill was so good in the role--so dryly funny, sharp when he needed to be, who had great chemistry with everyone he worked alongside (particularly Sheen). And he did such an effective job reminding of us Charlie's backstory (his mother was a cop shot in the line of duty) just by flashing a haunted look or reacting with understated but powerful emotion as he becomes a crucial part of the Bartlet family. He's backgrounded in later seasons and the show suffers for it. - DS</p> <p>Signature Episode: Second season episode ""Shibboleth,"" where Bartlet gives him the family carving knives. Oh man. I'm just gonna need a second here. ""You idiot! I'm Joey Lucas!"" When Joey Lucas storms into Josh's office in season one's ""Take This Sabbath Day,"" Josh can't figure out what the hell is going on. He's seeing a man talking, a woman wildly signing, and he's just hung over enough to not get any of it. Joey cuts right through his bullshit, just as her polls do. That's a good encapsulation of who Joey is: hardcore, trustworthy, and exactly what the show needed to shake its own optimism up a bit with hard, cold numbers. All while being effortlessly charming, of course. - KOSignature Episode: ""Bartlet's Third State of the Union,"" the season two episode that sees Joey most in her element. She runs a room of pollsters with aplomb, providing a refreshing counterbalance to Josh's manic energy. It's easy to knock Sam for being the cheeriest of Bartlet's original team. He's relentlessly optimistic in the face of the cynicism of Washington. He has moments of brilliance as a speechwriter, even if he isn't as good as his mentor Toby. But most of all, he just makes you want to love him. It's a shame Lowe chose to leave in the show's fourth season - the series lost a bit of heart without him around. - KOSignature Episode: ""Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail,"" in which Sam's natural optimism clashes with a tough situation involving Donna's friend - all the while facing the truth of his father's infidelity. Fitz could have been a tough-as-nails officer who didn't respect the president for his lack of military experience and held staid, traditional values about what belongs in the military. We certainly saw those types elsewhere in The West Wing. But the admiral was far better than all those tropes, coming across as both dogged and compassionate. It made his death in season five's ""Gaza"" all the harder to deal with. He was, unquestionably, one of the good ones. - KOSignature Episode: ""We Killed Yamamoto,"" from season three. Specifically, the scene in which he speaks the episode's title, which was easily Amos' best work of the series. For the bulk of her time on The West Wing, Mrs. Landingham was good for a walk-by scene, prodding the President to eat better, bickering playfully with Leo (""Ah, sarcasm. The grumpy man's wit""), mentoring Charlie. It was at the end of season two, when Mrs. Landingham was tragically killed in a car accident, serving as inspiration for Bartlet's operatic holler at God in ""Two Cathedrals,"" that the character truly attained her elevated status. - JR</p> <p>Signature Episode:  ""In Excelsis Deo,"" wherein she accompanies Toby to a military funeral for a homeless veteran, and she explains the fate of her sons to Charlie. When Ainsley Hayes was introduced, it really seemed like we were getting in on the ground floor of a major new character. An underestimated Republican working in a hostile (at first ... and still kinda after) Bartlet White House. Ainsley's first episodes were the kind of episodes you give to a character who's about to make a big impact. Then she ended up only appearing sporadically across the next couple seasons and ultimately fled to CSI: Miami (though not before blaming it on the bossa nova). Aaron Sorkin really shouldn't have been smoking crack. - JRSignature Episode: ""And It's Surely to Their Credit,"" wherein Ainsley has her first day on the job at the White House, is subject to some gross harrassment, and corrects Lionel Tribbey on the subject of Gilbert and Sullivan. Lookit! It's little Elisabeth Moss as the President's kid daughter! This was the introduction for so many of us to a wonderful actress and Zoey was really the only Bartlet daughter that felt fully realized. In the early seasons she's a vital little spark of energy who shows up from time to time--her romance with Charlie was adorable, her embarrassed eye-rolling at her dad helped humanize Bartlet, and at the same time we were constantly reminded what a precarious, tough thing it would be to be a college-aged daughter of the president. Sorkin made her the centerpiece of the explosive fourth-season finale where he basically engineered the most insane cliffhanger possible. It required Zoey to be a bit of a pain with her fancy French boyfriend, but Moss always made her relatable, even when the plot required otherwise. - DSSignature Episode: Season one's ""Mr. Willis of Ohio,"" where she is part of a mild altercation at a bar and her father has to remind her, in horrifying terms, of what a national crisis it would be if she was ever kidnapped. For as much as The West Wing was pegged as a liberal fantasy during its first five seasons, the real fairy tale arrived in season six with Senator Arnold Vinick: Socially Liberal Republican. It's a credit to Alda (and the improved season seven writing) that the character became so compelling, and even cruelly plausible. - JRSignature Episode: ""In God We Trust,"" wherein Vinick deals with the touchy (especially within his own party) subject of his lack of religious devotion. Josh ended up surprisingly low because one of our writers (*cough* Kevin) doesn't think much of him, but he is inarguably the show's most consistently dominant character. As Bartlet recedes in power during the final seasons, the main focus snaps almost entirely to Josh as he runs the Santos campaign. Arrogant, blustery and often tragically funny in the early seasons (where more often than not he is undone by hubris), Josh sharpens into a more serious, still manic flag-holder for sharp-elbowed Democratic ideals; his pragmatic evolution is basically the same one the show undergoes after Sorkin leaves. His will-they-won't-they with Donna became an irritatingly dominant storyline, but in those early seasons, it was hard not to drink up their mansplainy sessions together. - DS</p> <p>Signature Episode: Season two's ""Noel,"" which, through a painful therapy session, charts Josh's intensely suppressed PTSD following his brush with death in season one's assassination attempt. It's Whitford's finest work on the show and a beautifully-done look at his arrogance and bluster brushing up against his darkest insecurities. Five episodes is probably the right number for Lord John, British diplomat and advisor about matters of state. He's a lot to take, but in the limited doses that we got of him, he was an invigorating and amusing presence. Yes, he was pretty sexual-harrassy. But so good-natured about it! One the real, though, Lord John calling Leo McGarry ""Gerald"" was the best running gag the show ever had. - JRSignature Episode: You'd think it would be the episode that bears his name, ""Lord John Marbury,"" his debut. But it's ""Dead Irish Writers,"" wherein he crashes Abbey Bartlet's birthday party and debates British/Irish relations with Toby. Lionel Tribbey was the first, and maybe the best, of many White House Counsels who would come down the pike, brandishing a cricket bat and unfurling furious monologue after furious monologue as he's forced to add a Republican (Ainsley Hayes) to his staff. John Laroquette is hilarious; it's kinda too bad he wasn't around for the MS storyline later on in the season. - DSSignature Episode: ""And It's Surely to Their Credit"" is the only time he appeared, but isn't he great? My gosh, was John Hoynes a bastard sometimes. But he was a bastard who made for some great storylines. The degree to which Vice President Hoynes was or was not antagonistic to the Bartlet White House was unpredictable and ever-changing; his arguments with Leo, C. J., Josh, and especially the President were electric. He was the best kind of complicating factor in the West Wing universe. His resignation (in disgrace over a sex scandal) was a necessary plot development to get us to the Walken presidency at the end of season four, but it was always too bad a good character like Hoynes had to go. Signature Episode: ""Five Votes Down,"" which gives us Good Hoynes (he suggests Leo attend his secret AA meeting) and Devious Hoynes (he snakes the credit for a gun-control bill).Agent Ron Butterfield of the Secret Service was never the most expressive character. By his very nature as the head of the Presidential Detail, he had to play things fairly close to vest. But it was when he let that veneer drop that we really fell for him. - KOSignature Episode: ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen Part II"" is one of said examples, and it's probably the greatest. The whole two-parter is great for Butterfield, especially while taking care of the president after he gets shot. But the second half features a scene with Toby where the communications director tries to take the fall for the president's shooting. Butterfield manages to be both strong and comforting. ""It was the act of madmen,"" he says. Then, almost humorously, he repeats the party line: ""Anyway, the Secret Service doesn't comment on procedure.""</p> <p>Hired to replace Sam Seaborn, Malina was hobbled from the start by the high bar he had to clear, and he didn't get a ton of time to mix with the other White House staffers before he jumped ship to the Bob Russell office, and later campaign. There, he becoming a semi-antagonist for the fifth and sixth seasons, as he tried to position a man we knew was going to lose towards the Presidency. Bailey got cute again in the last season as one of the few staffers left to rattle around in the White House while the campaign rages, but he never really recovered from the whole side-switching debacle. - DSSignature Episode: ""Election Night,"" his second, in season four. He was so damn charming, dancing in the rain and running a Congressional campaign for a dead man! Carol's the best. She was C. J. 's right hand throughout her entire term as press secretary, and presumably she stuck around for the Annabeth/Toby/Will clown show that came thereafter. God, she must've been so annoyed during those last few years. Anyway, of all the assistants, Carol probably had the highest-percentage competence-to-drama ratio. Nothing rattled her. She could banter with C.J. about the lyrical meaning of ""I'm Too Sexy,"" then shoot Josh Lyman a death glare for screwing up his lone attempt at a press briefing, all before breaking for lunch. - JRSignature Episode: Honestly, look at the death glare she shoots at Josh at 3:14 of this clip from ""Celestial Navigation."" She might not even have a line in that episode and she steals it. Season five was an absolute wasteland for good new characters - with few exceptions, everyone introduced just didn't quite fit with the rest of the established world. Not so with Commander Kate Harper of the NSA. She had tremendous shoes to fill, taking over the advisory role from Nancy McNally, but McCormack defied the odds and charmed us. By the end of the series, she was just as much a part of the main cast as those who had been there from the start. - KOSignature Episode: ""Ninety Miles Away,"" where we learn the secrets of her past with Leo. It was built up to be more than it is, but her work in the episode is lovely. One of the best late-season additions to the show, Lou was the Santos campaign's communications director in the seventh season and had an even sharper tongue than the sharpest Bartlet advisors. When imagining an eighth season for the show, Garofalo's cold-as-ice badass probably would have been the new Toby of the cast, and it's too bad we never got to see it. Still, she's a vital foil to Josh in that seventh season as the team carries Santos over the finish line. - DS</p> <p>Signature Episode: ""The Mommy Problem,"" in which she comes aboard the Santos campaign to address his lack of definition in the mind of the American populace. Immediately, you realize she was what was missing from the team in the sixth season. Maybe he's not quite as electrifying as Tribbey, but Babish is real important in the second season as the MS scandal starts to blow up in Bartlet's face. Even more so than Toby, he could challenge the President, and practically talk down to him, in a way most staffers would be too cowed to do; his abrasive no-bull approach was one size fits all, which was just what the President needed to weather his cover-up. Like so many Sorkin characters, he's introduced like he's going to be around forever, but quickly vanishes. But he made a real impact in those first episodes. - DSSignature Episode: Season two's ""Bad Moon Rising,"" where he smashes the tape recorder with the judge's gavel. Sorkin knew how to write an introduction. Debbie was always going to be an odd fit into the West Wing universe. How could she not be, replacing sweet old Mrs. Landingham? Credit to Lily Tomlin and the writers for giving Debbie her own unique, but no less special relationship with the President. - JRSignature Episode: ""20 Hours in America,"" where Debbie returns from her disastrous first interview to finally impress the President with her second. Chief Justice Evelyn Baker Lang only appeared once, but what an appearance it was. She stole our hearts with a complex, smartly delivered monologue about her approach to a case. She was brilliant, and Close made her so much more. Every moment Close is on screen - including and especially her awe before being named as the nominee to become Chief Justice - is pure magic. - KOSignature Episode: Well, that'd be ""The Supremes,"" since it's her only episode, but major points for appearing in the best episode of season five - some would say the only episode of season five worth talking about at all. Leo's attorney seems shoehorned into The West Wing at first, with the audience sold on a romance between the two from basically the word go. But give it up for Jordon Kendall; she makes you wish she'd never leave within moments on the screen. She's the perfect foil for Leo: determined while he's easygoing, cutting through his molasses-slow storytelling to get to the point. She's funny and tough as nails - we just wish she didn't have to go so soon. - KOSignature Episode: ""Bartlet for America,"" her introductory installment. Her flirty banter with Leo is great, but never makes her seem slight or unformidable.</p> <p>Here's that rare Sorkin recurring character who actually comes back, and for good reason. Silver's deadpan tough-guy opportunism served the show well in the third season as Bartlet ran for re-election and needed an outsider to keep his message in line. Then, after Silver made a very public political switch and became a prominent George W. Bush supporter, the show brought him back to serve as Arnold Vinick's campaign director, one of the smartest moves it made in season seven. Throughout, Gianelli was a model pragmatist, who knew that the big-minded idealism of anyone he worked for could trip them up in an effort to get votes. - DSSignature Episode: Season three's ""Gone Quiet,"" where tries to shake Sam out of an idealistic stupor. ""I really don't care who's right, who's wrong. We're both right, we're both wrong,"" he barks. There have been a lot of great Secret Service characters on The West Wing, but no one embodied Gina's mix of robotic professionalism and sublimated heart that goes into being a bodyguard quite as well. She's always Zoey's chum, a bit of a big sister figure and a fearless soldier who would dive in front of gunfire for her. Toscano's arc ends at the assassination of the season one finale, but every subsequent Secret Service character felt like it was building off of her. - DSSignature Episodes: ""What Kind of Day Has It Been?"" is told, a little bit, through Gina's keen eyes as she spots the shooters, not quickly enough, who give us our first-season cliffhanger. You'd be forgiven for allowing the campaign staff members in the last two seasons to blend together a bit. There were so many of them! They all kind of did the same thing! But that's why Sheila, played subtly and expertly by Patricia Richardson, stands out. She's a close friend and confidante to Arnie Vinick, matching his fairly moderate politics and reminding him of his humanity on the trail. Her story during the election ends rather heartbreakingly ... - KOSignature Episode: ... during ""The Cold,"" when she takes the fall for the campaign's problems. She sacrifices herself for the right reasons - namely, that she believes Vinick needs to pull right to win - which makes his eventual loss without her all the harder.33. Roberto Mendoza (Edward James Olmos): the hardheaded but brilliant judge the team fights to get confirmed to the Supreme Court in season one. Spoiler: They succeed.34. Danny Concannon (Timothy Busfield): C.J. 's Pulitzer-winning press paramour who proved to be the most delightful thorn in her side.35. Matt Santos (Jimmy Smits): the Democratic candidate to succeed Bartlet (spoiler: he wins). Nice enough guy, if perhaps a little bland.</p> <p>36. Ginger (Kim Webster): the communications aide who was quite affected after Bartlet was shot. A consistent presence on The West Wing, and an enjoyable one.37. Ellie Bartlet Faison (Nina Siemaszko): Bartlet's doctor daughter who gets married in the show's final season. She's interesting in her first appearance, but suffers from the non-Sorkin team not quite getting her character.38. Kenny Thurman (Bill O'Brien): Joey Lucas' sign language interpreter who appeared by her side every season. Hugely likable, and quite cute to boot.39. Donna Moss (Janel Moloney): Josh Lyman's assistant and the eventual Chief of Staff to First Lady Helen Santos. Easily the most controversial of the core cast members not named ""Mandy.""40. Mallory O'Brien (Allison Smith): the school teacher who, to Sam's immense surprise, was Leo's daughter. She was perhaps the perfect match for Sam, making it all the sadder they didn't work out.41. Bonnie (Devika Parikh): a communications aide who left the show early into its fifth season. We'll give her actress credit for knowing when to jump ship.42. Andi Wyatt (Kathleen York): a congresswoman from Maryland and Toby's ex-wife. Eventually has children with Toby, is generally wonderful (if one-note) throughout the series.43. Millicent Griffith (Mary Kay Place): the surgeon general and close friend to the Bartlet family. Notable for supporting the decriminalization of marijuana long before it was cool. Rock on, Millie.44. Mike Casper (Clark Gregg): an FBI agent friendly with both Josh and the administration. Though all the Avengers fans might think he was secretly Phil Coulson all along.45. Albie Duncan (Hal Holbrook): the insufferable and yet oh-so-hilarious state department official. One of the only characters to consistently irritate Bartlet.46. Tabitha Fortis (Laura Dern): the Poet Laureate who protested U. S. use of landmines. May or may not be so high on this list because she was played by Laura Dern.47. Bob Russell (Gary Cole): the dim - or is he? - second Vice President, chosen as a middle-ground option after Congress forced Bartlet away from his first choice. Eventually ran for president and lost, becoming increasingly less likable along the way.48. Annabeth Schott (Kristin Chenoweth): the adorable pixie of a Deputy Press Secretary. Was terrified of briefing the press, which seems an exceedingly stupid thing for a Deputy Press Secretary to be afraid of.49. Cathy (Suzy Nakamura): Sam Seaborn's assistant for season one. Was sent to Mandyville along with Mandy herself between seasons.50. Glen Allen Walken (John Goodman): the Speaker-turned-president who took over while Zoey was missing. The show wanted him to be more of a villain than he was.51. Bram Howard (Matthew Del Negro): a member of the Santos campaign. We can't remember much that he did, but he was very cute.</p> <p>52. Laurie (Lisa Edelstein): the escort who Sam slept with accidentally. Wanted to become a lawyer, forged a friendship with Sam, then disappeared to Mandyville when her storyline ended.53. Cliff Calley (Mark Feuerstein): the Deputy Chief of Staff who took over for Josh despite being a Republican. He also took part in the House Oversight Committee hearings about Bartlet's MS, and stopped another member from leaking information about Leo. He also dated Donna, so you've got to take the bitter with the better.54. Simon Donovan (Mark Harmon): C. J. 's Secret Service agent who became romantically entangled with her. Unfortunately for her, he was shot and killed just after they kissed for the first time.55. Connie Tate (Connie Britton): one of Bruno's campaign staffers, and the much easier to get along with of the two. Sadly, she was fairly unremarkable otherwise, which feels like a waste of Britton.56. Howard Stackhouse (George Coe): the Democratic senator who stood up - literally, it was a filibuster - for autism awareness. He later ran as a third-party candidate against Bartlet for re-election and maybe overstayed his welcome a tiiiiny bit. 57. Liz Bartlet Westin (Annabeth Gish): the oldest daughter of the Bartlet family. Had terrible taste in men if her husband was any indication.58. Deborah O'Leary (CCH Pounder): the gung-ho Secretary for Housing and Urban Development who Leo had to reprimand for getting too mouthy. Free CCH Pounder!59. Chris (Mindy Seeger): one of the longest-lasting members of the White House Press Corps. Known for her frizzy hair, her glasses, and being inimitable.60. Jane Braun (Melinda McGraw): She's the ruthless campaign manager brought in by the RNC to salvage Arnold Vinick's campaign after the nuclear-plant fiasco.Jane was an envigorating presence, but replacing Sheila made her hard to love.61. Christopher Mulready (William Fichtner): The halo of ""The Supremes"" stretches wide, and Mulready makes it to the middle of this list on the strength of one and a half scenes, going toe-to-toe with Jed, Toby, and future Chief Justice Evelyn Lang.62. Katie Witt (Kris Murphy): Another long-time member of the White House Press Corps, Katie once let the President bum a cigarette off of her on Air Force One.63. Joe Willis (Al Fann): We wouldn't have the episode ""Mr. Willis of Ohio"" without him. Or we would, but it would have been called something else.64. Joe Quincy (Matthew Perry): Ugh, this one. We always got the sense that we were supposed to be far more enthralled with Joe Quincy than we were. Another token Republican in the White House counsel's office. Could he hold a candle to Ainsley Hayes? HE COULD NOT. (Ugh, Matthew Perry got two Emmy nominations out of this role, too.)65. Bob Mayer (Stephen Root): A loyal Vinick campaign staffer. Kind of a waste of Stephen ""Jimmy James"" Root, if we're being honest.</p> <p>66. Molly O'Connor (Kimberly Bigsby): Molly's greatest contribution to the West Wing universe was getting killed by Zoe's kidnappers, then becoming the namesake for one of Toby's babies. So you can see why her upward mobility on this list would be limited. 67. Edie Ortega (Diana Maria Riva): That Edie was only in eight episodes seems totally unfair. She was the workhorse of that Santos campaign. 68. Ed (Peter James Smith): So much better than Larry. 69. Otto (Ramon De Ocampo): Remember when Josh chewed out Otto when he was over-stressed during the post-election transition? That was a bad day for Otto. Remember when Otto went to go have drunken sex with Lou the night before the election? That was a better day for Otto. 70. Wesley Davis (Taye Diggs): You knew something really bad was going to happen when all of a sudden Taye Diggs got cast as a supposedly unimportant Secret Service agent. 71. Larry (William Duffy): So much worse than Ed. 72. Nicholas Alexander (Terry O'Quinn): General Alexander was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs after Fitzwallace, and while he succeeded before Fitz was killed, it still feels like we lost Fitz and got this guy, so it was hard to warm up. It was before Lost happened and made Terry O'Quinn beloved, too. 73. Ronna Beckman (Karis Campbell): The Santos campaign staffer who went on to be the President's main secretary, i.e. the new Mrs. Landingham (okay, the new Debbie Fidderer). 74. Nancy (Renee Estevez): Our least favorite of the White House assistants. Mostly because nepotism is bogus. 75. Ann Stark (Felicity Huffman): Only one episode for devious, hardball-playing Republican operative Ann. Which is too bad, because anyone who can get one over on Toby would have been a formidable foe. 76. Steve (Charles Noland): Another White House press corps member of long standing. He got a bittersweet little moment in the press room with C. J. in the series finale. 77. Jenny McGarry (Sara Botsford): Far be it from us to be uncharitable to a woman cuckolded by her husband's job, but she couldn't have anticipated how busy Leo would be as White House chief of staff? 78. Roy Ashland (Milo O'Shea): Another Supreme Court justice with absolutely no time for wishy-washy Jed Bartlet. It seemed like the West Wing universe was waiting for this guy to croak forever. Instead, he retired to pave the way for Evelyn Baker Lang. 79. Greg Brock (Sam Robards): If you really despise the NASA leak storyline that ended up costing Toby his job, you probably don't have much time for Greg Brock, the reporter who Toby leaked the story to. Don't blame Greg. It's not his fault the writers wanted to crib from the Judy Miller/Valerie Plame story.80. Doug Wegland (Evan Handler): It seems the room was none too high on Doug, easily the most confrontational of the team Bruno Gianelli brought in to help the Bartlet re-election campaign. But he was good as a thorn in Toby's side.</p> <p>81. Theodore Barrow (Ron Canada): The Undersecretary of State for (we think) matters in Asia, Barrow never made much of an impression beyond the fact that Ron Canada cuts an authoritative figure. 82. Helen Santos (Teri Polo): The success of The Fosters has turned us around on Teri Polo, but that doesn't change the fact that Helen Santos was kind of a pill. Enough with wife characters who only exist to fret and nag and try to keep their husbands from doing the things the audience wants them to do, please.83. Jack Reese (Christian Slater): Another dumb would-be paramour for Donna. His big moment was talking about a space-aged ashtray that breaks into three equal-sized, non-sharp pieces. Riveting.84. Jeff Haffley (Steven Culp): It was an early sign of post-Sorkin troubles that The West Wing suddenly got a sneering villain in Speaker of the House Haffley, but Culp played the role well, and it was reeeeeally satisfying when he got beat on the budget crisis. 85. Arthur Leeds (Randy Brooks): The second-least interesting of the White House press corps regulars. 86. Mark O'Donnell (Timothy Davis-Reed): The least interesting of the White House press corps regulars. 87. Miles Hutchinson (Steve Ryan): Before he was lesson-giving J. Walter Weatherman, Steve Ryan played the particularly uncooperative Secretary of Defense. In particular, he challenged C. J. 's authority as chief of staff.88. Mark Richardson (Thom Barry): the Congressman who chewed Leo out about his crappy anti-crime law, and rightly castigated him for playing the race card, in season one's ""Five Votes Down.""89. Al Keifer (John de Lancie): the venal, kinda-stupid pollster who is sleeping with Joey Lucas and thinks Americans care about flag-burning. Chump!90. Elsie Snuffin (Danica McKellar): Will Bailey's step-sister and speechwriting helper. Why didn't we get more of her? She had gumption!91. Angela Blake (Michael Hyatt): The damage-control lady brought in for season 5 after Josh melts down. A reminder of one of the show's worst arcs.92. Rev. Al Caldwell (F. William Parker): A more-moderate Christian leader who isn't quite as hard-line as Mary Marsh. His best work comes in ""Shibboleth.""93. Talmidge Cregg (Donald Moffat): C.J. 's dad, striken with Alzheimer's. Ugh, ""The Long Goodbye"" is such a cloying episode.94. Vic Faison (Ben Weber): Ellie's husband, a scientific researcher who Bartlet calls ""the fruit fly guy."" Very nice and harmless, not very into his crowded White House wedding though.95. Rina (Melissa Marsala): Toby's assistant communications director in season five. Not very memorable.96. Josephine McGarry (Deborah Hedwall): Leo's sister, a school superintendent who helped arrest two students for praying. She's only in the one episode, where Leo has to ask her to withdraw her name from a recess appointment list.</p> <p>97. Colin Ayres (Jason Isaacs): a war photographer and one of Donna's many dull love interests.98. Ryan Pierce (Jesse Bradford): Josh's intern, the nephew of a Senator, who is very annoying very quickly and banished to Mandyville. Really helps clog up season 5 though.99. Ray Sullivan (Brett Cullen): Vinick's ticket-balancing choice for Vice President, a socially conservative West Virginia Governor brought in to quell concerns about Vinick's belief in God. A bit of a hammy stereotype.101. Peyton Cabot Harrison III (Ken Howard): the team's original choice to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, maybe a little racist, definitely has questionable views on the right to privacy.102. Mary Marsh (Annie Corley): a hard-line member of the Religious Right, used as a straw man for Bartlet to knock down in the pilot episode. Representative of some of Sorkin's weaknesses re: stereotyping.103. Joseph Crouch (Mason Adams): a bad-ass, super-old Supreme Court Justice who retires and calls Bartlet a pansy. He's the one who gets Mendoza's foot in the door.104. Ned Carlson (Evan Arnold): a nice aide to Santos who gets reassigned in season seven and never comes back.105. Eric Baker (Ed O'Neill): the little-seen, much-discussed Governor of Pennsylvania who everyone is afraid will seize the Democratic nomination in later seasons but always is besieged by plot twists. The show ends with him looking like Santos' likely VP after Leo's death.106. Lisa Sherborne (Traylor Howard): Sam's ex-fiancee, a reporter, who he dumped to join the Bartlet campaign. Sorry!107. Robert Ritchie (James Brolin): Governor of Florida and the Republican nominee in Bartlet's second election. Comes off as a dumb idiot filled with empty campaign slogans. Sorkin's worst straw-man.108. Curtis Carruthers (Ben Murray): Charlie's replacement as the President's body-man, so, we hate him.109. Jean-Paul (Trent Ford): Zoey's stupid French boyfriend who doses her with GHB and gets her kidnapped. WE HATE YOU JEAN-PAUL.110. Diane Mathers (Kathrin Middleton): A nasty talk-show host who interrogates Zoey about her kidnapping. She's mean and she sucks.111. Doug Westin (Steven Eckholdt): Liz Bartlet's husband, a fat-headed jerk who has an affair and runs for Congress on the Bartlet coattails. Not a very well-written character.112. Peter Lillienfield (Holmes Osborne): a venal Republican who publicly throws Leo under the bus for his substance abuse problems.113. Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly): Congrats, Mandy! You are not at the bottom of this list, although you are certainly the least popular credited cast member in the history of the show! She's only in the first season and she's basically an annoying problem throughout, never fitting into the cast dynamic or having a very well-defined role. Sorkin wrote her to be the opponent to pretty much every good thing the team wanted to do, so that didn't help.114. Taylor Reid (Jay Mohr): A Bill O'Reilly-style jabbering cable news talking head who exists only to stir up controversy and be awful. He gets in a public fight with C. J. once and is generally the worst.This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire. We want to hear what you think about this article.

Artists are among the pro-democratic protesters and each one of them should use their skills to support the people and the revolution.""</p> <p>""I am sure that people are happy seeing the stencils. I see them taking pictures of them quite often."" Chico commented. ""In the last few days, I have noticed that there are other artists who create stencils and their works can be spotted in different corners of the city. This is wonderful. as everybody able to do something should not wait.""</p> <p>Chico and Temeem's art has a very short life and is swiftly removed by the authorities. But they do not give up. ""There are around eight to ten different stencils around the Downtown area and we will keep creating them, no matter how long they remain.""</p> <p>Chico has been asked several times to create stencils on protesters' t-shirts but at this stage this might not be possible as they have to stay away from the spotlight. ""We are hoping to do something bigger very soon,"" Temeem added.</p> <p>In his conversation with Ahram Online, Chico stressed a very important message to all the pro-democracy protesters saying: ""Do not give up! Keep fighting for democracy and for freedom of expression, regardless of the consequences."" Temeem added that ""Whoever has an opinion should voice it now. It's been too long we were submissive, now it's time we speak up.""</p>","Yes"

Later in 2005, Top Desk International Limited was established, a business consultancy and procurement firm, also co-founded Agric General Manager Limited where I served as General Manager.</p> <p>I joined politics in 2000 when I started working with President Muhammadu Buhari under the membership of All Peoples Party (APP) which was later transitioned into the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) and was a founding member of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in Kaduna State.</p> <p>With about a decade of insight into various sectors, especially communications, and full understanding of the limitations of a private individual in solving some of the challenges the country is faced with, I decided to be more actively involved in politics in 2010, and subsequently resigned all corporate and businesses positions I occupied.</p> <p>In 2010, I served as the caretaker organizing secretary of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and subsequently as Campaign Coordinator for the Kaduna state chapter of President Muhammadu Buhari's presidential campaign in 2011, while also seeking to represent the people of Kaduna North in the House of Representatives. Convinced of my political adroitness, genuine love for the people and will to bring about desired change, the people of Kaduna North Federal constituency, I was elected as a representative in the Nigerian House of Representatives in 2011 where I served till 2015.</p> <p>As a member of the House, I made significant contributions to Nigeria's Information, Communication and Technology sector both at the industry and grassroots level. Appointed as Deputy Chairman of House Committee on Communication, alongside with my colleagues where we performed crucial oversight functions which led to positive growth and reforms of the sector.</p> <p>At the grassroots level, in a bid to promote ICT in my constituency and bring to my people, especially the youths, up to speed with obtainable standards in the world, I led various changes including the building of an ICT centre in Kaduna State University and the installation of 250 units of computer systems, internet and interconnecting devices toppled with high end ICT facilities, power generator and solar borehole in the same institution.</p> <p>I also insured the installation of computers and other ICT facilities in schools such as GSS day (boys) Doka, Kaduna, GSS U/Sarki Kaduna, GSS Independence way Kaduna, Sardauna Memorial College Kaduna, and many others. From 2012 till date, over 1500 students benefitted from my scholarship program on information and communication.</p> <p>My contribution to the people of my constituency were not limited to ICT alone as other sectors such health, water and education are affected immensely. To improve learning through the provision of learning aids and facilities and a conducive environment, I renovated several class rooms and staff offices in U/Rimi Low Cost Model primary school Kaduna, built additional class rooms, toilets and staff room in Shehu Abdullahi college, Maiburji ward Kaduna, completed Islamiyya school U/Rimi Kaduna, donated 220 double seater desks and chairs each to schools including Rimi College Kaduna, GSS Dalet barrack kawo Kaduna, L. E.A. primary school Malali and G.S.S Badarawa, and sponsored over 1000 students on tutorials and payments of examinations such as WAEC, NECO and JAMB from 2012 till date. I also constructed boreholes in various communities in Kaduna North to provide access to clean water.</p> <p>I founded ""The Shehu ABG Foundation"" which offers completely free services and has trained hundreds of young people from 2009 till date and consistently sponsored two outreach programmes every year, with 80-100 people benefitting from each. Every year from 2011 to date, women and youths are trained in various skills and empowered them with start-up funds.</p> <p>I believed that my love for quality, equal opportunity and leadership style endeared me greatly to my people which in 2014, I was honoured by my then political party, APC Kaduna Chapter, for showing ""exemplary and visionary leadership"" and for my absolute commitment to uplifting the people whom I represent. In 2012, I sponsored a medical outreach programme from which over 10,000 people benefitted. This was commissioned by the then Speaker (and now governor of Sokoto State), Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. In continuation of this tradition of reaching out to people who most required assistance, I sponsored another medical outreach in 2017, which over 5,000 people also benefitted from.</p> <p>Presently, I serve as the Special Adviser on Special Duties to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara.</p>","Yes"

 - particularly 'Open Letter To The PRS' and 'Napsterism'.</p> <p>After the judgement on Napster, where do you think the future of music on</p> <p>> the internet lies?</p> <p>The tragedy about it is that it means the record
 industry can once again re-establish the status quo.</p> <p>What people tend to
 forget is that a judgement has not been made on whether or not Napster is aiding
 copyright infringement, nor that its users are copyright infringers. The
 injunction has been served with the assumption that Napster would be defeated in
 court: guilty until proven innocent.</p> <p>I think file-sharing has a big part to
 play, mainly because it's an extremely efficient way of distributing music
 online. The Napster system as it currently exists and as they're suggesting it
 should be removes all the difficulties of encoding and hosting tracks.</p> <p>I
 can't help but suspect that the record industry knows this and simply wants to
 own the distribution route and the strongest brand online, which in this case is
 Napster.</p> <p>What do you think about the current state of the British music industry?</p> <p>Is there too much emphasis on looks instead of music?</p> <p>There's always been
 an emphasis on showmanship and image in pop music. I don't think that's a
 problem and can see value in original pop bands who have an interesting look.</p> <p>What pisses me off is the huge number of identikit stereotype manufactured
 made-by-numbers acts. It's damaging to music in general and people will grow up
 with the idea that instead of creating great art and learning to write great
 songs, the way to make an impact in music is to meet the right managers,
 stylists and producers, get a record deal and learn your formation dance
 moves.</p> <p>Some of the indie bands are almost as bad, though, with a formulaic
 faded denim look and a sound to match. A little originality goes a long way,

In her youth, she was a competitive swimmer.","She took up rowing when she was at university as a social activity.","<p>Sport is something that has always been a part of Darvill's lifestyle. It began when her mother enrolled her in competitive swimming in her hometown of Mississauga, Canada at the age of 11. Darvill can recall her swim coach as a tough, successful woman who pushed her athletes to test their limits. This experience in Darvill's formative years provided her with the grounding for her personal philosophy, first as an athlete and then as a coach.</p> <p>""You can't set limits for yourself. That's the really great thing about sport. You don't really know what your body can do. Sport offers you the stage to see where you can push yourself,"" says Darvill.</p> <p>Following an extensive competitive career in swimming, Darvill tried rowing as a social sport in university. Little did she know how much success she would find on the water, rather than in it.</p> <p>Darvill's first international start put her one place off of the podium in the lightweight women's double sculls for Canada in 1991. Two year later, she found the top of the podium as World Champion in the lightweight women's single sculls. That year was a special year for Darvill. ""We had a fantastic team. It was the first time the men and women were training together and we all thrived on the competitiveness of the workouts.""</p> <p>Having dual citizenship, enabled Darvill to compete for Germany where she added more medals to her collection. In 2000 she ended her international career after ten seasons and ten international medals, including gold in the lightweight double at the 1997 World Rowing Championships. ""There were always components of high performance sport that I loved,"" says Darvill. ""I thrived on hard work and enjoyed the challenge of great competition.""</p> <p>Darvill began working with Canada's under 23 women's team in 2009 as the lead coach. Success followed quickly, although she is willing to deflect any credit to the athletes themselves. ""It's really exciting to see these women come into the programme, full of raw talent and sometimes with self doubt, and then have them come out with a whole new outlook on what they are capable of. My goal is to motivate them to train hard, row well and move on to success within the senior squad.""</p> <p>Using her vast experience as an athlete, Darvill was able to provide her team with a competitive advantage. As part of her role, she travels to local clubs and universities to discuss training programmes, technique and racing strategy with coaches. Her training programme has now contributed to many under-23 medals including an under-23 World Best Time in 2011 in the women's eight.</p> <p>Earlier this month at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne, Switzerland, the Canadian women's eight, quadruple sculls and lightweight double sculls won gold, silver and bronze medals respectively. This medal count is impressive as it includes a diverse range of disciplines - sculling, sweep and lightweight. Of the 15 seats available in these boats, ten were occupied by graduates of Darvill's programme.</p> <p>Included in Darvill's philosophy for success is her belief that young athletes need to be exposed a high performance environment and understand that success comes with dedication to consistent and focused practice.</p> <p>""Michelle has a talent for identifying athletes, and preparing them for international racing,"" says Canada's women's performance director, John Keogh. ""She also has done a fantastic job of liaising and developing partnerships throughout Canada and the United States with university and club coaches who in turn contribute to our next generation.""</p> <p>The words of Darvill's first swimming coach and her subsequent experience as an elite athlete has served Darvill well as she continues to seek out Canada's future Olympians.</p>","Yes"

dream of being the founder of a successful companies like CognitionX, Rightster or Project Placed?</p> <p>T: As a young girl I wanted to be anything I thought was impossible for young girls. A taxi driver, vicar, astronaut, mainly because I didn't see women in these roles. When I set my mind on an actual career I wanted to be in advertising, I loved the idea of telling stories on a grand scale but after years of internships at the top london agencies I felt downtrodden by the slow pace of change and sadly very masculine environments.</p> <p>N: It sounds a lot like an episode of Mad Men. The tech industry isn't much easier, in fact it could be harder to crack. Why would you say a gender diverse environment is important to you + your company's success?</p> <p>T: It's what makes the world go round. Without a balance everything is out of kilter. I believe without a balance of opinion I worry we wouldn't be building the right product, making the right decisions or solving the right problems. I make a conscious effort to try and see as many female candidates for a role as male. It's getting a little easier for those straight out of university but we have a long way to go.</p> <p>N: I'll agree with you. Policies like GPG reporting are going to encourage firms to update their search and hiring strategies so they can meet targets, but given that it is only applicable to larger firms I worry that smaller firms aren't spending as much time as they should thinking diversity through in early start-up stages. You're an advisor to start-ups. Is gender equality something you coach them on?</p> <p>T: Constantly! It's not about fairness, it's good business logic. I help in anyway I can to get startups to understand the importance of hiring, fostering and believing in women. I advise two young male founders and their birthday + Christmas presents have always been biographies of female CEOs because I want them to understand what it feels like to be a woman in this environment.</p> <p>N: I love that. I think it's really important for women to start telling their stories and for the world (not only aspiring female technologists) to listen. So in saying that, what do you think are the most important steps toward bridging the gender gap in technology?</p> <p>T: Education, we need to ensure girls feel like they can pick the more tech subjects and excel in them. There are some fantastic organisations in the UK who are focused on this and I think I can already feel the affect but there is a lot more to do.</p> <p>Strong role models. There is an infinite list of women who I try to learn from every day. I started a Twitter group ""Learn from Other Women"" to collate their useful and often inspirational and wise words.</p>","No"

He served for a short time in the U.S.","Navy before starting his professional music career as an opening act for The Chambers Brothers.","<p>Asked by famed rock photographer Herb Greene to name his favorite guitarist, Jerry Garcia replied, ""Mike Wilhelm."" Charles Perry said it all in a Rolling Stone Magazine review of Mike's first solo album when he wrote, ""Wilhelm's voice is so tough and effective that it's scarcely credible that he's doing all that slick finger-picking at the same time, but the song was done in one take.""</p> <p>Being a founding member of San Francisco's first psychedelic rock band, the amazing Charlatans, Mike Wilhelm staked his claim in Rock and Roll history early on. The musical earthquake that happened in and around San Francisco in the mid '60s, which would go around the globe in waves, was generated by five sharp-dressed, curious and visionary musicians about to touch new land; the dawn of psychedelic rock and the fashion, image and culture that would follow was loudly trumpeted by the appearance of the amazing Charlatans. The dancehall and festival culture as well as the Vietnam protest movement were direct results of a youth that wanted to open their minds while embracing the world.</p> <p>While still a teenager, he ran into Walter ""Brownie"" McGhee, the legendary bluesman and partner of Sonny Terry. McGhee, described by Mike as ""a most generous teacher"", taught Wilhelm his fingerpicking licks. Highly talented Mike impressed McGhee so much that he taught him at no charge and obviously very, very well. His fingerpicking creates the illusion that you hear at least one more guitar. His slide work has an elegant silverish tone and accuracy, both the softness and bite of a panther. He is a cultural bridge between Robert Johnson, Jimi Hendrix and Johnny Cash.</p> <p>His career led him around the world, playing LA's famed Whisky a Go-Go and Berlin's historic Sportpalast as well as the legendary Avalon, Fillmore and Winterland, touring Japan and Europe, working with Janis Joplin's Big Brother and the Holding Company, Chicago blues great Nick ""the Greek"" Gravenites, playing and recording with Quicksilver Messenger Service's John Cipollina, influencing West Coast Sound and establishing trends as art forms with his bands the Charlatans, Loose Gravel and Flamin' Groovies. Mike tells the story of this land and its people when doing songs such as Pizen Switch and Betty And Dupree on six or twelve strings.</p> <p>Writer H. C.

But in the spring of 1966, on the grounds of Rancho Olompali just north of San Francisco, Garcia had reason to believe Hunter was gunning for him, causing the great guitarist to royally freak out. The misunderstanding unfolded when Hunter decided to drop some LSD and bring a loaded .30-30 Winchester rifle to a party at the Dead's new Marin County hangout. Hunter never intended to strike fear into the heart of his genial host, but when he did, he was so high that he began to panic--perhaps he hadaccidentally shot someone, if not Garcia, after all. It took a long bummer of a night, and three of Hunter's closest friends, to shake that demon thought from his troubled mind.</p> <p>You've probably never heard of the ""Incident at Olompali,"" as no one has called it since, and your awareness of the Charlatans is likely limited to seeing the band's name on scores of vintage rock posters, alongside more familiar monikers such as Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Grateful Dead.</p> <p>That's too bad, because in their heyday, from 1965 to 1968, the Charlatans were a lot of people's favorite band, thanks to a danceable mix of distinctively American musical genres--from the blues and rock to Western swing and jazz. Around the time of the Charlatans' first paying gig, in June of 1965, the Grateful Dead were still playing pizza parlors as the Warlocks, Jefferson Airplane had yet to take off, Big Brother was a year away from handing Janis Joplin a microphone, and Quicksilver was not even a gleam in anyone's eye. By 1966, the Charlatans had a record deal with the same label that had released the 1965 smash hit ""Do You Believe In Magic?"" by the Lovin' Spoonful.</p> <p>Given their head start as performers, the Charlatans should have been one of the biggest music acts of the 1960s. They were doing acid tests before anyone even called them that, and were the first band to promote itself with a poster and perform while bathed in the glow of a light show. Just as importantly, the Charlatans were trailblazers at a moment in musical history when rock bands were being rewarded for conforming to the new psychedelic orthodoxy. In particular, the band's embrace of Americana was years ahead of the Byrds, Grateful Dead, and Eagles, who also wove threads pillaged from those genres into their repertoires. That's not to give the Charlatans credit for ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" and ""Workingman's Dead""--or blame for ""Desperado""--but they got to the Americana party first.</p> <p>All of this should have worked in their favor, but by the Summer of Love in 1967, the band was self-destructing, and by the time Jimi Hendrix was playing the last notes of ""Hey Joe"" at Woodstock in the summer of 1969, the Charlatans were history.

The Charlatans presented themselves with an iconic blend of Americana-infused popular styles, encompassing olde-English folk, country, swing, bluegrass and 50s rock'n'roll.

To commemorate this momentous occasion, the Charlatans are returning to the Comstock for two unprecedented performances. On Saturday, June 20th the Charlatans will hit the stage for ""A Night at the Opera"" at the historic Piper's Opera House. This show will be followed by a ""Meet and Greet"" after party at the Red Dog Saloon. On June 21st, they will make rock history playing their final performance as a group at the Red Dog Saloon, ""Locked and Loaded - The Red Dog Experience."" In addition to the Charlatans sets, there will be dramatic re-enactments of the most infamous stories from 1965. Both the Opera House and the Red Dog performances will feature light shows by Bill Ham, the originator of the liquid projection light show and co-creator of the light show machine that colored the Red Dog in 1965.</p> <p>Tickets for Saturday at Piper's are $75 or $100 for both Piper's and the after party at the Red Dog. Tickets for Sunday at the Red Dog Saloon are $100. A discount ticket for all events is $175. Seating is extremely limited, and these shows are expected to sell out. Tickets are available from http://www.reddogvc.com/ or by phoning the Red Dog at 775-847-7474. Doors open at 7:00 pm.</p> <p>Performing will be all four living original members of the band, George Hunter, Richard Olsen, Mike Wilhelm and Dan Hicks. Playing with them on drums is Texas Music Hall of Famer Freddie Steady Krc. On piano is Tom ""TC"" Constanten, former keyboardist of the Grateful Dead who also has a host of credits of his own.</p> <p>The Charlatans were the first of the San Francisco ""psychedelic rock"" bands. Their summer long residence at the Red Dog Saloon starting on June 21, 1965 introduced nearly all of the features which were to be the hallmarks of the San Francisco ballroom dance/concert scene including the first ""psychedelic"" poster by Charlatan members George Hunter and Mike Ferguson, now known as ""the seed"". Other innovations were the light show, style of dress, long jams and eclectic electric music. The Red Dog begat the Family Dog. The story is detailed in a documentary film by Mary Works. For more information go to http://www.reddogsaloonfilm.com/.</p> <p>The Charlatans have dedicated these shows to the memory of Charlatans pianist Mike Ferguson, Lynne Hughes (aka Miss Kitty), Chandler Laughlin (aka Travus T. Hipp), Red Dog proprietor Mark Unobsky and all of the other beloved members of the Red Dog Gang who are now playing with The Really Big Band.</p> <p>S. F.'s '60s rock scene started</p> <p>with a band you never heard of</p> <p>The Charlatans: Dan Hicks (left), Mike Wilhelm (seated), Richard Olson and George Hunter pose in their Sonoma, Calif. rehearsal space Wednesday June 10, 2015. The Charlatans, a hugely influential psychedelic band of the 1960s, is getting back together for some performances in Virginia City, Nevada.</p> <p>The Grateful Dead may be holding multimillion-dollar concerts in football stadiums to mark 50 years in the business, but the real golden anniversary of the San Francisco scene will be celebrated in a somewhat less exalted fashion this weekend in a small ghost town in the Nevada hills, which, oddly enough, is where it all really did begin.</p> <p>Today the band is little recalled by those who weren't there, but the Charlatans were the first important new rock band in San Francisco when LSD first rolled through town and things started getting weird. When the five-man band of Edwardian dandies in immaculate vintage wear returned from playing all summer 1965 at the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City, the Charlatans were the headline attraction at A Tribute to Dr. Strange, the Longshoreman's Hall dance/concert that was ground zero for the '60s San Francisco rock scene. It was the night it all began. Farther down the program that evening was another new band just starting out at a former pizza parlor in the Marina with the peculiar name of Jefferson Airplane.</p> <p>In a few months, that order would be reversed and, rather quickly after that, the Charlatans' brief reign would be eclipsed by other new bands, but for that primal moment, the Charlatans were the unquestioned stars of the new scene.</p> <p>""Any kind of history, we'll be in there,"" says Dan Hicks, who was the band's drummer. ""There'll be all the groups everybody knew -- the Airplane, the Dead and us. Who? Fred Smud?""</p> <p>""It doesn't pay to be first,"" says bassist Richie Olsen.</p> <p>They have gathered in recent weeks at the rustic Sonoma creekside home of founder George Hunter, who lives in a mini-Winchester Mystery House with shelves of fixtures and hardware in almost every room and out in the yard, projects under way everywhere. Under the leafy canopy above a large skylight, the four original members have crowded into Hunter's book-lined study to work up a couple of dozen songs, enough for two sets, along with hired hands Audie DeLone on keyboard and Freddy Krc on drums.</p> <p>""It always cracks me up when they talk about how old the Stones are,"" says guitarist Mike Wilhelm. ""Real musicians don't retire.""</p> <p>They were always characters, and age hasn't entirely mellowed them. They are alternately annoyed and oblivious with each other, both friendly and prickly, like in a long marriage. Or like four codgers who have played music off and on together since they were kids and never really managed to shake off having been the Charlatans, at one time the coolest band on the planet.</p> <p>The band first re-formed in 1996 to celebrate the release of a documentary film, ""Rockin' at the Red Dog,"" by filmmaker Mary Works, whose father, Don Works, was a gun-slinging hippie bartender at the Red Dog. ""It's just an 18-year break,"" says Hicks. ""We're not starting from scratch. Sounds like a lot -- 18 years -- but at this point in life, it's just a little segment of the calendar.""</p> <p>Once again, Hunter designed a poster for the event. The one he drew 50 years ago, called ""The Seed"" by collectors, is commonly considered the first psychedelic rock poster. Of course, in typical hippie fashion, the date on the original poster says June 15, but work on the saloon wasn't done in time and the opening did not take place until June 21. That's the date that will be celebrated at the Red Dog, a century-old dance hall that had been restored back then and staffed by a group of acid heads, long-haired freaks in beards and handlebar mustaches who dressed the part in cowboy clothes and sidearms. (The band will play a slightly larger hall in Virginia City the night before, Piper's Opera House, a 19th century building with a raked stage and sprung dance floor.) The Red Dog show is already sold out, and the Opera House show is expected to be as well.</p> <p>Artist Bill Ham will be at the reunion to re-create the psychedelic light show he invented for the Charlatans' original run at the Red Dog. The Red Dog turned out to be the laboratory experiment that birthed the San Francisco ballrooms. The original promoters of the acid-rock dances, called the Family Dog, visited Virginia City that summer. Olsen remembers Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters pulling up to the Red Dog in their famous repurposed school bus, called Furthur, the day Olsen went back to San Francisco. (Replacing the Charlatans at the club was another new San Francisco band called Big Brother and the Holding Company, yet to find their female vocalist).</p> <p>No actual rock bands deserve to be called legendary, but the Charlatans' status is special. Although the band's place is firmly lodged in the history of San Francisco rock, the group remains so obscure that a bunch of upstart Britpop rockers in the '90s thought they could simply appropriate the name. They were advised otherwise by the San Francisco band's attorney and arrived in this country calling themselves the Charlatans UK.</p> <p>Although the Charlatans never released an album during the band's active lifetime, archivist Alec Palao pieced together an extensive 1996 CD collection of unreleased studio experiments and live recording for an English record company. ""We are well known in Europe -- more than here -- but we've never set foot on European soil,"" Hunter says.</p> <p>""Maybe they're thinking of the other band,"" Olsen says.</p> <p>A kindly, mumbling absent-minded-professor type, Hunter built architectural models and dreamed up his rock band, designed the logo and figured out the look before he ever contacted other musicians or, for that matter, even learned to play a musical instrument himself.</p> <p>Smitten with the Beatles and the Stones, he met Olsen at a bus stop and was delighted to discover that he actually knew how to play music. They recruited former surf guitarist Mike Wilhelm, and Santa Rosa Junior College student Dan Hicks replaced the original drummer. Hicks graduated from college, failed his draft physical and left for the Red Dog with the Charlatans all in the same week. Hunter taught himself Autoharp to play in the band.</p> <p>The irony of belonging to a ""legendary"" band is not lost on Hunter. ""It crosses my mind every day,"" he says. ""Where's the f-- money? We are called an anomaly -- is that the right word?""</p> <p>""I don't know what I really think about it, but it is sort of puzzling,"" he says.</p> <p>Joel Selvin is a former San Francisco Chronicle music critic and a Bay Area author.</p> <p>[Note: Recent Entries Have Been Archived at: Mike Wilhelm & Hired Guns</p> <p>and at: (Mike Wilhelm)      Solo Performances & Photographs]</p> <p>Most artists have edited Strawberry Roan lyrics.</p> <p>Here are the complete lyrics as written by Curley Fletcher, 1915.</p> <p>I'm a-layin' around just spendin' my time, Out of a job and ain't holdin' a dime, When a fellow steps up and says, ""I suppose That you're a bronc fighter by the looks of your clothes."" ""You figures me right, I'm a good one,"" I claim, ""Do you happen to have any bad ones to tame?"" He says he's got one, a bad one to buck, And for throwin' good riders, he's had lots of luck.</p> <p>He says that this pony has never been rode, That the boys that gets on him is bound to get throwed; Well I gets all excited and asks what he pays To ride that old pony for a couple of days. He offered a ten-spot, I says ""I'm your man, 'Cause the bronc never lived that I couldn't fan; The horse never lived, he never drew breath, That I couldn't ride 'til he starved plumb to death.</p> <p>""I don't like to brag but I got this to say, That I ain't been piled in many a day."" Says he, ""Get your saddle, I'll give you a chance."" So I gets in his buckboard and drifts to his ranch. I stays until mornin' and right after chuck, I steps out to see if this outlaw can buck. Down in the horse corral standin' alone Was this caballo, a strawberry roan.</p> <p>His legs is all spavined, he's got pigeon toes, Little pig eyes and a big Roman nose, Little pin ears that touch at the tip And a double square iron stamped on his hip. Ewe-necked and old with a long lower jaw, I can see with one eye, he's a reg'lar outlaw. I puts on my spurs - I'm sure feelin' fine - Turns up my hat and picks up my twine.</p> <p>I throws that loop on him and well I know then, That before he gets rode, I'll sure earn that ten, I get my blinds on him and it sure was a fight, Next come my saddle, I screws it down tight. Then I piles on him and raises the blind, I'm right in his middle to see him unwind. Well, he bows his old neck and I guess he unwound, For he seems to quit livin' down on the ground.</p> <p>He goes up toward the east and comes down toward the west; To stay in his middle, I'm doin' my best. He sure is frog-walkin', he heaves a big sigh. He only lacks wings for to be on the fly. He turns his old belly right up towards the sun, He sure is a sun-fishin' son of a gun. He is the worst bucker I've seen on the range; He can turn on a nickel and give you some change.</p> <p>While he's a-buckin', he squeals like a shoat, I tell you, that pony has sure got my goat. I claim that, no foolin', that bronc could sure step But I'm still in my saddle, a-buildin' a rep. He hits on all fours and suns up his side, I don't see how he keeps from sheddin' his hide. I loses my stirrups and also my hat, I'm grabbin' the leather and blind as a bat.</p> <p>With a phenomenal jump, he goes up on high, And I'm settin' on nothin', way up in the sky, And then I turns over and comes back to earth And lights into cussin' the day of his birth. I knows the horses I ain't able to ride Is some of them livin' - they haven't all died, But I bets all my money there ain't no man alive, That can stay with that bronc when he makes that high dive!</p> <p>Photographs  from May 3, 2012,  Presidio Yacht Club by Keizo Yamazawa</p> <p>Mike Wilhelm recognized as Great Blues Artist of San Francisco</p> <p>and Inducted in the, American Heritage International Blues Hall of Fame, March 14, 2012</p> <p>I again have CDs available of the solo acoustic blues album Keys to the Highway...

Both tunes from the late '70s and songwriting credit is Jordan/Wilson.</p> <p>1967: Jerry Garcia was asked to name his favorite     guitarist on the San Francisco scene. His quick reply? ""Mike Wilhelm.""</p> <p>2008: Mike's marvelous new self-produced acoustic       CD, Keys to the Highway, displays the guitarist's stellar abilities as       a stand-alone bluesman, in the manner of his heroes Brownie McGhee and       Robert Johnson.</p> <p>The veteran guitarist is now 66 years old. He began studying       blues while still a teenager with legendary Tennessee bluesman Walter ""Brownie"" McGhee. Mike had run into him in Los Angeles, quite by chance. He enthuses, ""I       told him I really dug his records. I wanted to know how he managed to get       that thumping bass and how he fingered his signature turnaround lick. Of       course, I had my guitar with me; I never went anywhere without it back       then! He asked for my guitar, showed me his set of fingerpicks and then       the lick. I almost couldn't believe it happened just like that! I bought       a set of fingerpicks the next day and a day or so later I had Brownie's     turnaround down. And so it began...""</p> <p>McGhee, recognizing Mike's talent and strong desire,       thoroughly schooled him at no charge. ""At one point I began to think       I was getting pretty damn good. Then Brownie told me that, once I could       play licks in the long A position, do bass runs at the same time and sing       over that intelligibly and with feeling, I could seriously consider myself       a blues guitarist. I mean, talk about setting the bar high! Even after       I began playing professionally, it was many years before I cracked that       nut. Even now, I'll make some really cool breakthrough, then suddenly I       get the flashback, 'Oh, right! Brownie tried to get me to do that     over 40 years ago!' I owe him so much, what a wonderful, generous man!""</p> <p>The bulk of these tracks are fresh renditions, including       his most recent sly update of Brownie's hard times classic, Pawnshop Blues. In The New New Old Pawnshop Blues, Mike sings about today's hard times       with wry humor...now the middle class has the blues! His arrangement of       Big Bill Broonzy's Key To The Highway stands out from the pack through       his use of the changes he ""learned from Brownie""...plus some       tricks of his own! Wilhelm is fond of introducing songs with, ""Here's       one from back when the blues had chord changes.""</p> <p>Eric Clapton made it trendy to cut Robert Johnson tunes but not even Clapton       did so without backup musicians. Here Mike has no problem pulling off three       of Johnson's songs with no overdubs. Like on Johnson's recordings, there       are times when I could almost swear I hear a second guitar but, with practiced       ease, Wilhelm can readily reproduce this illusion in live performance.</p> <p>Other old masters, the Reverend Gary Davis, Ma Rainey,       Blind Willie McTell, and W. C. Handy, are represented here as well. We       have two of Mike's moody 12-string instrumentals. Lakeview Shuffle is an       A-A-B-A format, unusual for delta blues. The eerie Ghost Train is like       nothing I've heard from any blues guitarist. Obviously not content to be       a slavish imitator, Wilhelm has created a style all his own while carefully       remaining true to the music he so obviously loves.</p> <p>He is, as he says, ""in all the rock history books"" as       a founding member of San Francisco's first psychedelic rock group, the       Charlatans, back in 1964. After the Charlatans broke up in 1969, he led       his own rock and roll trio, Loose Gravel, until 1976 when he joined cult       heroes Flamin' Groovies. The Flamin' Groovies are considered the fathers       of power pop. He toured and recorded extensively in both Europe and America     with the Groovies until 1982 when he began anew his solo career.</p> <p>Wilhelm has played solo all across the U. S., in Europe       and did solo tours of Japan in 1995 and 1997. 1997 also saw a series of       reunion concerts with the Charlatans culminating in their historic shows       at Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and San Francisco's       Fillmore. In 2007, Mike and the Charlatans played the 40th anniversary       of the Summer of Love in Golden Gate Park.</p> <p>In addition to his recent solo work, like Western Maryland       Blues Fest, he has been appearing with the very popular Lake County Blues       Allstars at local venues, such as the Blue Wing Blues Festival.</p> <p>""May the baby Jesus shut your mouth and open your       mind."" That's what it says on the Family Dog's logo and that's how     Lake County's finest guitarist, Mike Wilhelm, signs his e-mails these days.</p> <p>It's an anonymous quote, probably contributed by Family       Dog founder and Avalon Ballroom entrepreneur, Chet Helms, who died in June       2005. Helms was the power behind the throne of both the concert hall and       the people promoted shows.</p> <p>Wilhelm attended Helms' funeral where he says a large       urn containing Helms' ashes sat next to a smaller one with the overflow       and a blown up portrait of the anti-Bill Graham standing in front of Palo     Alto's Antonio's Nut House with its ""Hippies Use Side Door"" sign.</p> <p>Wilhelm's old band, The Charlatans (with Dan Hicks), played       the Avalon in the 60s -- as well as Virginia City's Red Dog Saloon, establishing       themselves as the first psychedelic band in San Francisco and Nevada.</p> <p>Charlatans George Hunter and the late Mike Ferguson also       produced the first psychedelic posters for Family Dog and the Avalon.</p> <p>Wilhelm, who is on the cover of one of the histories of       Haight-Ashbury, penned by an ex-Billboard editor, is all over the photos       in others in the company of Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson       Airplane, etc.</p> <p>Last year he had a problem with his hand, which was cured       by Chinese acupuncture. Later he was invited by Flamin' Groovies founder,       Cyril Jordan, to sit in at a Plimsouls Reunion/Magic Christian in San Francisco       at the Cafe du Nord on Market Street.</p> <p>Wilhelm was in the Flamin' Groovies, named the number       four SF band of all time by the Chronicle in 2000 (right after the Grateful       Dead) for six years. Magic Christian is Jordan's new band, with drummer       Prairie Prince (The Tubes), Roger Daltry-like lead vocalist ""without       the English accent,"" Paul Kopf, and British music archivist and bassist,     Alec Palao.</p> <p>Palao wrote the liner notes for the English issued ""The       Amazing Charlatans"" and produced boxed sets by The Zombies and Creedence       Clearwater Revival as well as the ever popular ""Nuggets"" anthologies     of one-hit wonders.</p> <p>Peter Case, who's just reformed his 70s band, The Plimsouls,       busked the streets of San Francisco in bygone times with Wilhelm and others.</p> <p>In his post-concert blog at www.petercase.com, Case describes       his dressing room reunion with the ""Kaiser:"" ""Wilhelm comes       in looking dapper and dangerous as usual, the quintessential SF musician/1890s       outlaw vibe ... and we start jammin' up there. I never play like this with       anybody. We do 'Stagolee,' (Mike's strange, rocking endless old ragtime       version with the big chorus no one's heard, the one we used to do on the     street).</p> <p>""Then 'Ella Speed,' the Mance Lipscomb song that       begins with the lines: 'first time I shot Ella, I shot her through the     side'... outrageous ... I'd cut an album of this stuff with Wilhelm ...""</p> <p>In a post-concert phone interview, Wilhelm gave his version       of the dressing room reunion: ""I brought my resonator guitar upstairs       with me so as to be able to go over the songs we would play at the jam       with Peter and his boys ... Peter and I reminisced about playing on the       streets of North Beach and Chinatown where we first met back in the early-mid       seventies ... Peter asked about my ragtime version of ""Stagger Lee,'       which has nearly endless verses and a chorus he has never heard anyone       else do ... I then started and Peter quickly joined in playing Mance Lipscomb's     decidedly original version of 'The Death of Ella Speed.' ""</p> <p>Wilhelm learned the latter from Lipscomb. That and his       having had Brownie McGee as his guitar teacher give the man a direct line       straight back to the old guys.</p> <p>My favorite Wilhelm stories still come from Lake County       though. One time, coming off a two-week isolation due to illness, Mike       came to my house and literally spent eight hours reminiscing about the       Flamin' Groovies legendary tours of Europe.</p> <p>In Manchester, England, he recalled, the Groovies played       one night after the legendarily volatile English-French punk rock band,       The Stranglers. Manchester is famous for its tough criticism so the Stranglers       actually went out, sought out the particularly vicious critic, and beat       him up.</p> <p>When the Groovies hit the stage the next night in the       Beatlesque costumes they then favored, the audience was, shall we day,       a tad unfriendly. So the band left, then Wilhelm came out again, alone, ""dapper       and dangerous as usual,"" as Case put it, and simply said in his Johnny       Cash deep bass voice: ""We agree with The Stranglers; there are older     laws.""</p> <p>The Manchester audience remained most respectful for the       rest of the evening.</p> <p>Another Wilhelm tale: When the Groovies played the Sports       Palace in Berlin, where Hitler made many of his speeches, not only was       it eerie, but when Mike hit the stage someone yelled out at the top of     their lungs -""(Expletive Deleted) you, Mike Wilhelm!</p> <p>Mike figures it was a response to his gesture towards     Bill Graham at the end of the film, ""The Last Days of the Fillmore.</p> <p>In any case, it was something akin to the infamous heckler       at the Dylan/Band concert at Royal Albert Hall.</p> <p>For the Sunday's last concert, Mike changed in the ""airless"" dressing       room, into his equally ""dapper"" outfit, a Black Italian suit       with a Crosby, Stills & Nash Fillmore tie, diplomat shirt with pale       blue stripes and white collar and cuffs. His spider-in-web cufflinks were     a gift from Richard Olsen (Charlatans) back in 1967.</p> <p>I once had dinner at a restaurant with Mike and his lovely       wife, Ana Maria, and he left the orginal 60s Charlatans black cowboy hat       behind. But, only briefly, as we went back and got it.</p> <p>You'll notice a lot of Wilhelm in George Thorogood, who       was taken in by the then Loose Gravel guitarist and taught most everything       he knows, including how to dress for performance. The Charlatans favored       a 19th Century frontier look that bands like the Doobie Brothers later       emulated for their robbing the stagecoach LP cover. Stevie Ray Vaughn's       hat comes to mind as well.</p> <p>Mike's only comment: ""Poor old misguided Bill Graham     is no longer around to collect the royalties on his necktie line.""</p> <p>In ""The Last Days of the Fillmore,"" Wilhelm       told Graham what he thought of him for not allowing Loose Gravel to play     in the recorded concert, via his middle finger.</p> <p>""Bill liked it so much,"" Wilhelm once told me, ""they     kept it in.""</p> <p>The man who told off Bill Graham didn't actually sit in       with Magic Christian Sunday night, as I thought he might. But the group       did a stellar set of mostly Jordan-penned originals from their new ""official       bootleg CD,"" which includes a live concert recorded at the Great American     Music Hall and a few old Groovies covers.</p> <p>The famously balding Jordan, sporting a wig, somehow managed       to make his Dan Armstrong plexiglass guitar sound exactly like George Harrison's     guitar on the original ""Tax Man.""</p> <p>Their set also featured ""Make My Bed,"" by the     Down Under Beatles, The Easybeats.</p> <p>Mike and Cyril joined the Plimsouls at the end of their       excellent set played to a sold out audience of 350 mostly younger people,       who probably don't remember the Charlatans.</p> <p>But the last time I saw Wilhelm open for Case, who was       then playing solo in SF, the audience screamed ""Charlatans, Charlatans,"" repeatedly,     something you don't hear in Lake County.</p> <p>But this crowd was no less enthusiastic for the reunited       Plimsouls and friends. In fact, I've talked to a surprising number of younger       folks who remember the original Plimsouls.</p> <p>When Jordan and Wilhelm joined the reunited band, they       brought the house down with covers of the Rolling Stones, Jimmy Reed, the       Groovies' classic, ""Jumpin' In The Night,' and even ""The House     of Blue Lights,"" sung by the Kaiser hisself.</p> <p>Before the show, I asked Mike if he was going to do Chuck       Berry's duckwalk, something I've seen him do a few times. He didn't and       he also didn't say why.</p> <p>Maybe, he's just saving the best for Lake County.</p> <p>An Unlikely Blast From the Past Film,</p> <p>CD bring S. F.'s Charlatans back to life</p> <p>As likely as being struck by a bolt from the blue, members       of a long-forgotten '60s San Francisco rock group suddenly find themselves       in the spotlight again, with a documentary film and a CD release of recordings       made 30 years ago.</p> <p>When the four surviving members of the Charlatans arrive       tonight at the Mill Valley Film Festival in a vintage limousine for the       world premiere of ""The Life and Times of the Red Dog Saloon,'' the musicians,       always conscious of how they looked, will disembark clad in the same sartorial     combination of Edwardian finery and Wild West wear that was their trademark.</p> <p>""We didn't go national,'' said Dan Hicks, who was the       band's drummer before starting a successful solo career. ""We didn't get     past Denver. We never made a record. Never toured. Never appeared on television.''</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Charlatans spent a brief but shining       moment at Olympian heights atop the nascent San Francisco rock scene, headlining       the first acid rock dance at Longshoreman's Hall, billed above the Jefferson       Airplane, which was also making its first concert appearance. But the Charlatans,       by virtue of their residency that summer at the fabled Red Dog Saloon in       Virginia City, Nev., were the stars of the show that night in September       1965 that marked the beginning of the San Francisco rock scene.</p> <p>Although the group came apart at the seams and finally       dissolved two years later, the musicians reunited eight years ago in a       successful legal battle to reclaim ownership of the various tapes the Charlatans       recorded. By coincidence, the release of ""The Amazing Charlatans,'' a       23-song British CD combining tapes from three sources (including an unreleased       1966 album), coincides with the debut of a documentary film by Mary Works,       the 29-year-old daughter of a couple who worked at the Red Dog Saloon 30     years ago.</p> <p>The Charlatans served as house band at the silver rush       dance hall, renovated by a bunch of crazed hippies playing cowboys and       Indians while high on LSD in the Sierra Nevada ghost town. In Works' engaging,       affectionate film, the Charlatans emerge as the centerpiece of a wild and       wacky little community, full of characters whose eyes still gleam as they       recall the glories of summer 1965.</p> <p>How They Ended Up</p> <p>""I was always afraid I'd lose you guys to Harrah's or       something,'' Red Dog proprietor Mark Unobski, who died earlier this year,     tells Richard Olsen of the Charlatans.</p> <p>Today Olsen heads one of San Francisco's leading society       dance bands. Hicks continues his solo work in performances across the country,       a career move he made even before leaving the band in 1968. Charlatans       founder George Hunter is a successful furniture designer living in Sonoma. Guitarist Mike Wilhelm lives in Clear Lake and considers himself retired. Pianist Mike Ferguson died in 1979, a blind diabetic amputee living on       welfare in Alameda.</p> <p>Assembling at Olsen's Inner Richmond home for a photo       shoot recently, Wilhelm easily fit into the Victorian waistcoat he wore       that summer in Virginia City, while Hicks said he no longer owns any of       his authentic Charlatans outfits (""I outgrew 'em,'' he said, patting his       waist. ""I have a belt buckle left''). Hunter needed to borrow an Autoharp;     he lent his to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.</p> <p>""Essentially I was wondering about the movie, would       it be of interest to anyone else,'' said Hicks. ""I mean, we have a film       of our frat party and we can always watch it and dig it. But I'd like other     people to see it.''</p> <p>The recordings on the British CD have been circulating       on European bootlegs for more than 20 years, but ""The Amazing Charlatans''       marks the first time the complete record of the band's studio sessions     has been assembled on one piece from the master tapes.</p> <p>There may be some truth to the musicians' jocular accusations       of each other that they were the source for the illicit bootlegs. Hunter       frankly admitted that he gave Rhino Records the one Charlatans track officially       rereleased in this country 10 years ago. ""I collected all the royalties     and didn't give any to the rest of the guys,'' he said.</p> <p>""It's not that we don't know about it,'' said Olsen. ""I have a complete accounting upstairs.''</p> <p>""I got rich on that one,'' said Hunter.</p> <p>But the new record also supplies some long-missing physical       evidence to counter an oft-repeated claim that although the Charlatans       always looked great, they never played that well. ""After listening to       this stuff and seeing it in perspective,'' said Hunter, ""I think we were     a lot better than we thought we were.''</p> <p>""We were certainly a lot better than we were given credit     for,'' said Olsen, still smarting.</p> <p>Indeed, Jerry Garcia often cited Wilhelm as his favorite       guitarist on the San Francisco scene. ""Some of the stuff I played back     then was so difficult I don't know how I did it,'' said Wilhelm.</p> <p>But the legend of the Charlatans has lingered, the image       of these gun-toting, guitar-playing dandies too delicious to fade away       entirely. Several years ago, in fact, a British rock group decided to simply       appropriate the band's name, although when Olsen warned the group's American       record label, the British upstarts suddenly turned up Stateside named Charlatans       U. K.</p> <p>""If we're not the Charlatans, who is?'' said Olsen. ""That's our name. They should think up their own.''</p> <p>With all the current activity bringing the band back       from the shadows of dim memories, talk inevitably turns to a return to       the stage. The band members obviously have discussed the possibility, envisioning       the four original members augmented by some of the musicians currently       performing with the Richard Olsen Orchestra.</p> <p>""Everybody's talking about it,'' said Wilhelm. ""But     nobody's talking about paying us.''</p> <p>1964, 2 of the Mainliners in George Hunter's front parlor, Mike Wilhelm and Sam Linde.</p> <p>Photo by Sam Linde from the Mike Wilhelm Collection</p>","No"

If we didn't have trust and respect in her we wouldn't have stayed [with her].""</p> <p>Moir said the pair have no ill-feelings towards Davis and White.</p> <p>""A lot's been made of that but we really do like Meryl and Charlie,"" he said, ""and we benefitted from training alongside them over the years.""</p> <p>Virtue and Moir also said they were frustrated but not surprised by a report in a French sports magazine that alleged U. S. and Russian judges colluded to give higher marks to skaters from their countries.</p> <p>""It sort of comes with the territory. We knew what we were getting into when we signed on for this,"" said Virtue. ""We were hoping if we did our job and left no room for doubt that it would be hard to deny us the gold.</p> <p>""But that said, we couldn't have done any more. We were so excited about our performances and the feeling we had when we finished both programs. There's nothing better than that. It's priceless.""</p> <p>BELOW: Watch Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue talk about calls for a boycott of the Sochi Paralympics.</p> <p>Moir said it was surprising to see judges fraternizing with skaters from their countries.</p> <p>""We've always been taught as Canadians that you keep your distance from the officials,"" he said. ""Sometimes in the back hallways you see people hugging and you're like, 'What are you doing? You're going to be on the panel in 20 minutes.' It is kind of awkward and bad for the sport.""</p> <p>Moir said there should be a competitive environment ""where everyone can be safe and be out there and be free of controversy. I mean, have true sport.""</p> <p>READ MORE: Full coverage of the Sochi Olympics</p> <p>The duo also weighed in on calls for Canada to boycott the Sochi Paralympics over Russia's threats to Ukraine and its crackdown on homosexuals.</p> <p>""We feel most for the athletes. To rob them of their experience and their opportunity doesn't seem right,"" Moir said. ""But at the same time there are major politics involved that are a little bit over our heads.""</p> <p>Virtue agreed. ""It would be just devastating to deny them their opportunity.""</p> <p>Moir and Virtue said they plan to spend time with their families and rest before hitting the road with the Stars On Ice tour. There are 12 shows in cities across Canada starting April 25 in Halifax and ending May 15 in Vancouver.</p> <p>""That's really fun for Tessa and I,"" Moir of Stars On Ice. ""We get to just go out there and enjoy ourselves.""</p> <p>BELOW: Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue talk to reporters at the Sochi Olympics in February 2014.</p>","Yes"

Suns' ball. Nash, the team's wily point guard, will let the clock nearly expire before executing a play. As Nash dribbles, Clippers point guard Baron Davis defends him closely. Guarding against the very play the Suns called. Guarding against Nash going right. Nash abandons the plan and darts left. Time to make up a new play. On the fly. To watch Steve Nash is to observe someone uncannily at ease with change. Rapid change. Whenever possible, he plays on the run, starting a fast break rather than a set play, orchestrating a free-form attack. What sounds like a recipe for sloppy basketball proves highly effective in Nash's hands. When Nash signed with Phoenix as a free agent in 2004, he took over the NBA's riskiest and most unorthodox offense, one that required his team to get a shot off in seven seconds or less. And Nash soared. Already an all-star, he became more dangerous at hyperspeed, choreographing a thrilling dance of snap decisions and eyes-in-the-back-of-his-head passes. He is only the ninth player in NBA history to win consecutive league MVP awards.No one better embodies the metabolism of our times, when industries, technologies, and careers are in constant flux. In leading Phoenix to the league's best record to start this season and, most likely, to a return to the play-offs, Nash demonstrates how to navigate uncertainty -- with flexibility, collaboration, and inventiveness. He has developed a gift for finding order in chaos. He adapts to new information, assesses the risks, and creates opportunities for him and his teammates to succeed. Nash improvises.We all need to be improvisers now, to transition between the jobs we have and the backup plans we may need to pursue in the current economic crisis. Between the ways we're accustomed to working and the new habits shaped by Twitter, Facebook, and other new tech tools. Between the recession and the postrecession world.Both on and off the court, Nash's exploits illuminate lessons about how to manage these transitions. The son of a professional soccer player, he didn't take up basketball until eighth grade, but then transformed himself into a top high-school player. At little-known Santa Clara University, in California, the only school to offer him a scholarship, he worked himself into a first-round NBA draft choice. He began as a bench player with an iffy back who later revamped his exercise regimen -- and his game -- to become a surefire Hall of Famer, the 38th best NBA player of all time, according to uber-blogger Bill Simmons in The Book of Basketball. Nash was a camera-shy and endorsement-averse pro even as he became an all-star; he now pitches ad ideas to Nike and Vitaminwater and relishes cameos on Entourage and The Late Show with David Letterman.Nash's future rides on his latest transition. He is 35 in a league where the average age is 27. So he's thinking a few steps ahead. He's becoming an entrepreneur, finding business outlets for his off-court creativity. ""I hate to say it, because the cliches can get nauseating, but I try to keep the ball moving,"" he says of his burgeoning enterprises. ""If you let things slow down, they lose momentum. ""Nash is still 25 feet from the basket. Scanning his options. He pivots. What to do next? Pass to Grant Hill on the wing? To Channing Frye near the basket? Take it himself?When Nash reached the NBA in 1996, he had a plan for how he would handle life as a pro: He wouldn't pursue the spotlight. He relished his privacy and was uncomfortable with the attention.After he made the all-star team in 2002 and helped turn the Dallas Mavericks into one of the league's top teams, Bill Sanders, CMO of BDA Sports, which represents Nash, wanted to build a brand around his budding star. In a league that celebrated one-on-one moves and showy acrobatic dunks, Nash, a very mortal 6-foot-3, was a fan favorite because he dazzled at a lower altitude with ball handling, passing wizardry, and team basketball. Nash listened to Sanders, and said what NBA players never say: I'll pass.He was the anomaly, an inquisitive guy who was reading No Logo, a dense and provocative argument by fellow Canadian Naomi Klein, which describes how companies had devolved into global marketing machines at the expense of innovation. Nash didn't want to be a pitchman. ""I felt there was an exploitation and manipulation going on,"" he says. The offers, whether endorsement deals or invitations to appear on The Tonight Show, were all a distraction from the discipline -- ""tunnel vision,"" he calls it -- that had gotten him to the NBA and enabled him to thrive there. Sanders dubbed him the ""reluctant icon."" BDA Sports CEO Bill Duffy says, ""There was a lot of John Lennon in him."" (Nash's T-shirt at the 2003 All-Star Game, a month before the invasion of Iraq: ""Shoot baskets, not people. "")Nash's change of heart came a few years later, after he reconnected with Jeff Mallett, a family friend who was president of Yahoo in its go-go years. They talked about life after basketball, and Nash admitted he hadn't given it much thought. After building Yahoo into the Web's No. 1 destination by the age of 40, Mallett himself had wrestled with the What now? question. ""I challenged Steve with an email that said, 'It's 20 years from now and you have 15 minutes to tell what you've done in the last 20 years,' "" Mallett recalls. "" 'If you mention basketball, you fail.' ""At the top of Nash's list was making a positive impact through his foundation, which helps poor, sick, abused, or neglected children get a shot at better education, health care, and opportunity. For years, he quietly wrote checks to charities. ""I had a real problem with getting attention for charitable giving,"" says Nash. ""I felt like that was a contradiction of the whole point."" He also had a problem saying no until he hired a childhood friend, a lawyer specializing in not-for-profits, to run his organization in 2005. The Steve Nash Foundation, much like Nash himself, is highly effective but not self-aggrandizing: The Sports Philanthropy Project and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave it the 2008 award for excellence in sports philanthropy, yet Nash's foundation didn't even issue a press release when it donated $200,000 to provide pediatric cardiology care for a hospital in his wife Alejandra's home country of Paraguay.Ultimately, Nash hopes the foundation outlives him. To make that happen, he realized he needed to be more pragmatic. Mallett suggested he think of the not-for-profit as a business. To be sustainable, it needs regular funding from the kind of for-profit companies Nash had kept at arm's length. ""I realized the foundation's power to help more kids was exponentially greater if you used all your resources,"" he says, ""be it visibility or corporate partners, and all those were contingent on people getting to know a bit more of you. ""It was time for the reluctant icon to pivot.Eight seconds to go.Nash flies toward the basket. He can still pass if the Clippers cut him off. They don't. He splits two defenders and has just enough room to attempt an off-balance layup. He swings his arm wide. Uses his off hand to flip the ball up. Sometimes his job is to make his teammates look good with perfect passes. But this time, he seizes the moment.A week before the season opener, Nash is in Vancouver, British Columbia, near his hometown of Victoria, for a preseason game. Everyone wants a piece of him. Barely arrived from the airport, he makes time at a downtown hotel for an independent film crew that's producing a documentary about him. He's dressed in jeans, a gray T-shirt, and slip-on canvas sneakers. No tattoos, no ego, no entourage. (The Suns may pay him $13 million a year, but he still showed up on the set of a video shoot in Manhattan two summers ago riding his skateboard.) He seems so, well, normal, a lean, mellow hipster with an easy smile, quick wit, and shy manner. He'd rather compare notes with the crew about camera equipment than talk about himself. These days, he says, more professional athletes ""think of themselves as a brand, but that's not my way of thinking. ""He lets the documentary interview run longer than scheduled. The same with a subsequent shoot related to the upcoming Olympics. The next day, after practice and a workout, he meets execs at the original Steve Nash Sports Club to hear how the burgeoning chain is courting Canadian Olympians and NBC staffers during the Games. That night, once the game and press conference are over, he returns to the court, his voice growing hoarse, to address a couple thousand rapt kids from Steve Nash Youth Basketball.Riding in an SUV between gigs, Nash texts with colleagues about his entrepreneurial projects (and checks on his wife and 5-year-old twin girls), giving his iPhone the kind of fierce workout he employs to protect a congenital disc problem in his back. ""Steve doesn't waste time,"" says Jenny Miller, executive director of his foundation.Nash now has a business plan for the newly formed Steve Nash Enterprises, a portfolio of a dozen ventures. He has started a film-production company; become a part owner of the Vancouver Whitecaps, which will join Major League Soccer in 2011; and taken equity in several startups, including Mission Skincare, which develops products for athletes based on field testing from him, Serena Williams, and other elite pros. Ultimately, part of the revenue will go to his foundation.His newest startup, Apoko, grew out of his affinity for social media. On Facebook, where he has nearly 600,000 fans (more than 100,000 people follow him on Twitter), he shares videos of himself -- playing a pickup game in China with locals; hanging out on the set of Katherine Heigl's next movie, Life As We Know It (he has a cameo); and sweating through Whitecaps training. While playing a charity game, he and the Clippers' Baron Davis discovered a mutual interest in film, which led to their making a spoof of Will Ferrell's Step Brothers. The video attracted more than 600,000 views on YouTube. As two of the most Web-savvy NBA players, they decided to help other athletes market themselves online. ""We'll help them build a fan base and create content,"" Nash says. ""That's the hard part for players. ""Nash, who honed his marketing chops interning at the New York ad agency Deutsch last summer, is making more connections between his various projects. His production company, Meathawk, filmed a promo for his skin-care outfit. He's written and produced viral videos for Nike and Vitaminwater, with which he has endorsement deals. ""The entrepreneurial stuff is exciting to me for the same reason that basketball is exciting,"" he says. ""It's collaborative, creative, educational, experiential. All those elements are in play. ""Six seconds to go.Nash's layup -- ""the old-white-guy-at-the-YMCA shot,"" he later calls it -- arches just beyond a defender's reach and drops in. The Suns lead by two. Davis catches the ball and slaps it in frustration.Nash's off-court daring and creativity have been best showcased with Meathawk Productions. ""It started purely as a creative outlet,"" he says. ""It wasn't, First, I need a business plan, second a CFO, and third a round of capital. It was like building a tree fort. We made it up as we went. ""Meathawk began in 2007, when Nash pitched Nike an idea for a Web video. A passionate environmentalist, he wears a Nike shoe made of recycled materials called Trash Talk, but he wasn't the centerpiece of a LeBron-like campaign. If he was going to boost his exposure, he might as well ask for creative control. ""Training Day"" depicts Nash's unconventional off-season regimen in New York, playing soccer and tennis, and dribbling a basketball while skateboarding. It captures his passion and versatility, as well as his free spirit.A few months later, Nash sold Nike on a more ambitious and expensive spot. ""The Sixty-Million-Dollar Man"" -- a spoof on the 1970s TV show The Six Million Dollar Man -- features Nash, who has survived countless SportsCenter-worthy collisions, being shattered into pieces and rebuilt. Like his shoe, he's completely recycled. This time, he asked that his cousin, London-based filmmaker Ezra Holland, direct, and offered to split the production costs with Nike. ""I was really lucky that it worked,"" Nash says. ""I don't think it's easy for them to step out of the way and let someone do what we did. ""Producing his own videos allows Nash to play the endorsement game on his terms -- and to reveal a sardonic sense of humor that superstar athletes rarely show the public. Shortly after he signed with Vitaminwater, the company agreed to green-light a couple of videos Nash wrote. In ""The Spokesman,"" he satirizes the stereotypical celebrity jock. Interrupting a typical day at Vitaminwater headquarters, he announces over the cubicles, ""Excuse me. While I'm here, does anyone need an autograph?"" He confronts an employee about having only one banana's worth of potassium in its bottled water. ""I want two,"" he says, cramming in a second banana. The irreverence fit the brand so well that Vitaminwater executives ran the viral video on TV during March Madness last year. ""Usually, it's a one-way street: companies go to athletes and try to convince them to do something,"" says Rohan Oza, Vitaminwater's CMO. ""I told Steve, 'You're not supposed to come in with a pitch and a production team ready to film. But I love that you do.' ""In 2008, Nash followed a similar strategy to get Meathawk's biggest gig yet. He heard about ESPN's 30-for-30 project -- 30 independent documentaries for its corresponding anniversary. The filmmakers, including notable veterans such as Barry Levinson, Peter Berg, and Ron Shelton, as well as newcomers, would tell personal stories about overlooked sports moments of the past three decades. Nash was the only pro athlete who pitched ESPN on a film.Over lunch in the West Village with ESPN Films executive producer Connor Schell, he recounted the story of Terry Fox. In 1980, the 21-year-old Canadian who had lost a leg to cancer began running across the country on his prosthesis to raise money for research. He ran near-marathons every day for 143 days until the spread of the bone cancer forced him to stop after more than 3,300 miles. The extraordinary effort made Fox, who died in 1981, a national hero. Nash had followed the trek as a boy. ""We never got the sense that Nash was a guy slapping his name on something,"" Schell says. ""The story was a personal passion. He's really talented at this, and he's willing to do his homework."" The one-hour documentary is scheduled to air in the spring.Nash and Holland have agreed to start small.

The royal party certainly made it easier because they are so good at doing that.""</p> <p>Mrs Docherty picked up the Queen when she arrived for the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony and was at her side when she opened the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</p> <p>And she also met Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Kate, Princes Edward and Andrew and Princess Anne.</p> <p>In her role as Lord Lieutenant, the Queen's representative in the city, she accompanied William, Kate and Harry when they visited Gorbals sports centre during the Commonwealth Games.</p> <p>She said: ""William and Harry were playing a bit of football and there was a wee bit of rivalry between them but also brotherly love.</p> <p>""A passing taxi driver who saw them approaching the sports centre lowered his window and asked Prince Harry if he fancied going for a pint.""</p> <p>The day after the closing ceremony of the Games, Mrs Docherty hosted the national commemoration of World War I which was attended by Prince Charles, Prime Minister David Cameron, three First Ministers and heads of state from across the Commonwealth.</p> <p>She was also the face of city when she visited New York for Tartan Day and met tennis superstar Andy Murray and American politician and diplomat Madeline Albright.</p> <p>Mrs Docherty also made trips to some of Glasgow's twin cities including Nurnberg for the annual Burns supper where she watched 200 Germans ceilidh dancing which she described as quite a sight.</p> <p>As Lord Provost she also made trips to Rostov on Don in Russia, Marseille in France and Bethlehem in Palestine.</p> <p>But the one visit which stands out in her mind was when she travelled to Malawi in association with Unicef on the 10th anniversary of the Lord Provost's Malawi Fund.</p> <p>She said: ""Malawi was a wonderful trip. The people in Malawi are so honest and kind and happy yet it is now the second poorest country in the world.</p> <p>""I was really struck by the level of poverty that many are facing. They live in mud huts and have to go to the well to get their water.</p> <p>""The families put an emphasis on education because they can see that is the way for their children to get out of poverty.</p> <p>""Young people will walk for hours to get to school to get and education in order to change their futures.""</p>","Yes"

This is the first  time a woman has occupied this position  and that is, in itself, worthy of note. Moreover her fame is connected to what  makes her a serious and important artist.</p> <p>Media treat her as a celebrity because they  have picked up on the fact that she is independently  popular, she has a 'fan base'. Who are these 'fans'? Mainly, though not  exclusively, they are younger women. They are part of the new expanded audience  for modern art, but they are not art  world insiders. They relate to Emin  because Emin's work relates to their experiences  in a way that no other artist's does.</p> <p>Most of her work is autobiographical. Its  main subject matter is her traumas and triumphs  growing up in Margate, and  becoming the person she is today. It is  often criticised for being 'self-centred'. This criticism completely misses the point  so eagerly seized on by her 'fans'. The  experiences re-presented in Emin's art are  not just personal experiences, but are  common to a wide layer of young women  growing up in this time, in this society. Normally these experiences remain  private, confided perhaps to 'best friends'  but otherwise hidden from public view and  therefore shameful. By making these experiences  into art, Emin actually engages in a  process of 'democratic sharing' with her  audience. The work is not didactic and  does not preach. It does not seek to impose  a specific response. It simply says, 'This is  what happened to me; this is how I felt  about it,' and perhaps, 'This is how I dealt  with it.' If it strikes a chord, as it evidently  often does, then so be it.</p> <p>Emin's first work to make a public impact,  her tent, or Everyone I Ever Slept With,  1963-95, was a good example of this. The  tent sat on the gallery floor. On the inside  Emin had sewn the names of her bedmates  of the previous 30 years. To see or experience  the work the viewer has to crawl into  the tent. Thus Emin has created a 'private'  space, a den with private information about  her life which the public is invited to share. The fact, which she stresses, that the names  included not just lovers but also others she  had shared 'the intimacy of sleep' with  (such as her twin brothers and aborted foetuses)  is important. It does not negate the  sexual interpretation of the title, but it  modifies it, ensuring that the sexual is not  separated from the emotional. What we are  offered to share is not gossip or titillation  but feelings, including painful feelings.</p> <p>Emin's most famous work, My Bed, is a  complex piece, which has appeared in different  forms, but essentially it works on the  same principle. According to the stereotype,  women are the homemakers and  responsible for housework. A messed-up  house shames a woman, makes her a 'slut',  much more than it does a man. The  bedroom and above all the bed itself represent  a place of privacy, intimacy and sex,  pain and illness. The stained sheets are a  visible trace of all this and thus taboo: 'You  don't wash your dirty linen in public.' My  Bed takes all this as its starting point and  confronts it, knowing that for some of us  all the time and many of us some of the  time it is a lie. It is a spectacular coming  out. And out there thousands, perhaps millions,  of people say, openly or privately,  'Yes! I've been there, I know what that's  about!' That is why My Bed is one of those  few works of contemporary art that captures  people's imagination and stays in the  public memory.</p> <p>Much of the media coverage of My Bed  seemed to assume that she had simply  transplanted her actual bed or bedroom  into the Tate. This, as a moment's thought  would have made clear, was nonsense. My  Bed, which had already appeared in Tokyo,  was a consciously constructed work, as  much a made work of art as Van Gogh's  painting of his bedroom. In so far as it was  a sufficiently convincing representation of a  disordered bedroom to persuade journalists  that it was the real thing, this is testimony  to Emin's skill. My Bed is also visually powerful  in its own right.</p> <p>Emin is a skilled practitioner in a range of  media. Her drawing is superb. She is able,  with great economy, to achieve very accurate  and telling representations. Her line  combines strength and vulnerability, confidence  and pain in exactly the right  proportions, and matching visual form to  intellectual/ emotional content is precisely  the key skill of the visual artist.</p> <p>Three of the themes in Emin's work--class,  sex and art--are more or less omnipresent  and make for its distinctiveness and power.</p> <p>Class: The most immediately striking and  unusual thing about both Emin's persona  and her work is the way in which she  positions herself as a working class artist.</p> <p>Clearly Emin is not currently working class.</p> <p>She is probably a millionaire and she functions,  as all successful visual artists do, as boss  of her own small business. Her class background  was complex. Until Emin was seven  her mother had a hotel in Margate, but  bankruptcy and poverty ensued when she  broke up with Emin's father, and Emin's  youth, whether or not strictly proletarian,  was plebeian. Nor is she an artist who sees  or presents herself as associated with or representative  of the working class movement.</p> <p>What she does do is present herself as culturally  working class. This is evident in the way  in which she conducts herself: in her accent,  of course, but more importantly in what she  says and how she says it. She makes no  attempt to engage in 'intellectual art speak'  but sticks to unaffected everyday language. This is highly unusual in the art world, the  ethos of which is very upper class. The language  used in her many appliqued blankets,  films and monoprint drawings is the language  of the street, including the swear  words, the grammatical errors and the misspellings. But, above all, the experiences her  art deals with are, by and large, the experiences  of working class girls.</p> <p>The short film Why I Never Became A  Dancer is one of her most important and  powerful works. It tells of Emin's aspiration  to be a dancer and her participation in a  dance competition in Margate, the prize for  which meant going to London. Just as she  feels things are going well she finds herself  surrounded by a circle of local lads (many  of whom she has had sex with). At first she  thinks they are clapping her, and then she  realises that in fact they are chanting in  unison 'Slag, Slag, Slag', and she runs from  the ballroom in dismay. The film ends with  her dancing, alone and just for herself, and  saying to the camera, 'Shane, Eddie, Tony,  Doug, Richard...this one's for you.' Of her  recent film on teenage suicide, Top Spot,  Amy Lane wrote in Socialist Review, 'There  is nothing that does not reflect the reality of  Britain's working class estates. It is a  painfully accurate portrayal of modern adolescent  experience'.1</p> <p>There is an element of class prejudice as  well as misogyny in the media and critical  hostility to Emin. Middle class critics often  miss the point of her work because the  kind of experiences she deals with are not  part of the world they inhabit.</p> <p>Emin's consciousness of this relationship  with her audience was evident in her fury  at Top Spot being given an 18 certificate by  the censors, preventing it from reaching  the very people it was intended for.</p> <p>It is often said that Emin is not political. If  this were true I would not find it a  problem for, as Trotsky insisted, art cannot  simply be judged on its politics. As it  happens it is not true. Emin does not see  herself as an artistic representative of a  working class political movement but she  does have a political consciousness and  outlook, and this is clear from many of her  public statements and appearances. She is  anti-racist, anti-homophobic, and anti-war. A colleague, who knows the London art  scene, says that in that world Emin is  known as 'a committed socialist'.</p> <p>I set this down for the record, but I do not  believe that either her leftish views or her  affluent lifestyle constitute major grounds  for the evaluation of her art.</p> <p>Sex: That sex should be a major theme in  Emin's work is hardly surprising. Sex has  been a central theme in European art from  the Renaissance to Picasso and beyond (not  to speak of Ancient Greece and Rome,  Japan and so on). But it should be said at  the outset, there is no element of eroticism  or titillation here, unlike in Botticelli,  Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or  dreams, as we might find in surrealism, or  the sex of the brothel featured so heavily in  late 19th century French art. It is real,  everyday sex--as experienced by her, of  course, but also by millions of other people. This, in itself, is remarkable. I do not think  there is a precedent for it in the whole of  European visual art.</p> <p>The history of art develops dialectically  with each new generation, movement or  individual artist usually defining themselves  in opposition to the immediately preceding  dominant trend. Part of this process  is the discovery of new material, both  physically and in terms of subject matter,  to make art out of, which was often previously  thought of as 'unartistic' (or vulgar,  ugly, etc). This is one of the reasons why  new art so often meets with the reaction  that it is 'not art'. Thus, mid 19th century  French art painted 'the heroism of modern  life' as opposed to the heroes of classical  mythology; and the Futurists and  Constructivists aestheticised the machine  and technology, previously anathema to  classicists and romantics alike. Picasso spoke  of the difficulty of finding a new subject  and cited Van Gogh's Boots as an example. Tracey Emin has found a new subject.</p> <p>A key feature of Emin's treatment of sex is  her disclosure of an early teenage phase of  promiscuity in Margate. In the voiceover  on Why I Never Became a Dancer she  describes it as follows:</p> <p>'And then there was sex. It was something  you could just do, and it was for free. Sex  was something simple. It didn't matter that  I was young, 13 or 14. It didn't matter that  they were men...19, 20, 25, 26. It never  crossed my mind to ask them what the  attraction was. I knew...sex was what it  was...'</p> <p>I suspect that even if it is not a majority  experience, such a phase among working  class girls is quite common, driven by a  complex mixture of low self-esteem, the  search for love, intimacy, pleasure, excitement,  desire to grow up, ambivalent  yearnings for a baby, and so on. Usually the  experience remains hidden, for obvious  reasons, from parents, or school and the  authorities. It therefore remains largely  unrecorded and unrepresented. Films and  novels have occasionally visited the territory,  but not, until now, the elevated world  of fine art.</p> <p>Emin's treatment of this experience appears  simple--a plain rendering of the facts--but  it is in fact quite complex and nuanced. In  Dancer she defends herself against the  charge of being a 'slag' and records her  conviction at the time that she was 'better  than all those boys'. But in Masculinity she  writes that she 'developed the ridiculous  habit of sleeping with men much older  than me'. She also claims that her promiscuous  phase was very 'educational' in an  interview for The South Bank Show. This  'ambivalence' towards her sexual experiences  runs throughout her work.</p> <p>Emin records many bad sexual experiences  in her art but she does not 'aestheticise'  them. She deals with childhood abuse,  humiliation, abandonment, rape and abortion  in the way these things actually happen  to women (never as her own or others'  fantasy material) and with the severe emotional  trauma and pain they caused. There  is no romanticisation of abjection.</p> <p>This central theme is held in tension with  two others. The first is that her experiences,  though often bad, have not proved insuperable. Yes, they were deeply painful but they  were not, including the rape, 'unspeakable'  or 'the worst thing imaginable'. She does  not revel in her suffering, only in her ability  to have overcome it. Why I Never Became A  Dancer ends with a seagull soaring up and  away from the shores of Margate.</p> <p>The second is the retention, despite the  traumas of the past, of an open, affirmative  attitude to sex and sexuality:</p> <p>'You don't fuck me over/You gently lift  me out of bed/Lay me on the floor/And  make love to me'2</p> <p>Holding these three elements, each of  them a humane and progressive response,  in tension with each other but without  allowing any of them to be compromised,  is a very considerable artistic and emotional  achievement.</p> <p>Emin does not present herself as a feminist  artist and is not generally thought of as  one. But, in dealing with sex Emin deals  also with sexism. Why I Never Became A  Dancer confronts the--very crude--sexism  rampant among certain teenage boys and  young men. My Bed challenges the sexist  attitude that makes a disordered bedroom  much more shameful for a woman than a  man. Indeed there is a sense in which the  totality of her art practice and persona  challenge the double standards about sex.</p> <p>The question of class interacts with the  question of sexism here. Emin is not seen  as a 'feminist' artist because feminism and,  especially, feminism in the art world has  been a largely middle class phenomenon,  focusing mainly on the issues that concern  middle class and professional women: especially  how women are represented in the  media, literature, art, etc. The issues Emin  deals with--how teenage girls get 'slagged  off' and 'broken into'--are not recognised  as feminist because they come from a different  world. But the fact is that Emin  tackles sexism at the sharp end.</p> <p>Art: 'I Need Art Like I Need God', is the  title and content of one of Emin's pieces in  neon lighting, and 'art', in particular  Emin's relationship to art, is a central  theme in her work.</p> <p>One of the ways 'art' features in Emin's  work is through her references to other  artists. Of course many artists do this, but  Emin's range of reference is broad and  impressive (which gives the lie to another  of the myths about her, namely that she is  some kind of 'primitive' or 'naif').</p> <p>Most obviously she is indebted to her hero  Edvard Munch, and to Egon Schiele. The  use of language in both the monoprints and  the blankets nods to Basquiat; the neon  lighting pieces are influenced by Don Flavin  and Bruce Naumann; My Bed recalls  Rauschenberg's Bed and, more subtly, the  bed of Manet's Olympia; The Helter Skelter  construction references the Tatlin tower; the  blanket work in general builds on the use of  sewing and textiles by feminist artists of the  1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>Of course if quoting other artists was the  main point of these works it would make  them banal, but with Emin's pieces this is  not the case. Her principal tribute to  Munch is Homage to Edvard Munch and All  my Dead Children and is accompanied by  her verbal scream which is truly disturbing  and terrible. Her drawings may owe something  to Schiele but are in no way  imitations or similar in content. In the case  of the blanket work Emin has transformed  the genre, freeing it of its craft and genteel  associations, and making it into vibrant  new form in its own right.</p> <p>As we know from Marx, in class societies  the ruling class invariably (if not completely)  dominates the culture. However  the domination in the field of visual art  has been more complete, more extreme  than in other art forms. This is because  whereas the poet or novelist needs only  pen and paper, visual art must be  embodied in materials (which are very  expensive), stored, and exhibited, either in  museums and galleries or in public places  (which of course are never controlled by  the public). And because in the capitalist  epoch the art market has focused on the  buying and selling of 'unique' and 'original'  works, in contrast to music and  literature, which centre on either the  large-scale selling of mechanical reproductions-- books, CDs, etc--or live performances  to collective audiences.</p> <p>As a result, from Tutankhamun to Lorenzo  de Medici and Henry VIII to Rockefeller  and Saatchi, visual art has been dominated  by the very rich and very powerful. This in  turn has meant that the exclusion and marginalisation  of working class people,  women and black people has been even  more marked in visual art than in other art  forms. There is no female painter whose  standing compares with Jane Austen or  George Eliot and not a single painting by a  black artist in the National Gallery. In this  context the work of Tracey Emin is both  an example of limited change that has  occurred and a challenge to the present  and the future.3</p> <p>Marx also tells us that art, like religion,  philosophy and politics, is part of the  superstructure of society, which arises from  and is conditioned by the economic base. I  would add that the economic base, that is,  the forces and relations of production,  gives rise to and shapes a developing  ensemble of social relations which range  from how people dress, to family and  sexual relations, to how people look at a  king or a beggar and how a king or a  beggar looks at the people, to how we  experience the sea, the countryside and the  city.</p> <p>What major art does is express and comment  upon these changing social relations in a  visually powerful way. Giotto and Brueghel,  Hals and Rembrandt, Hogarth and Goya,  Courbet, Picasso and Warhol all do this in  their differing ways. And so does Emin.</p> <p>The changing social relations that Emin  addresses are those shaping the relative  positions in society of women and men,  especially young working class women and  men. The changes in this sphere in the  course the last half century or so have been  spectacular: the huge rise in the number of  women (especially married women) in  paid labour, the Equal Pay Act, the Sex  Discrimination Act, the pill, legalised abortion,  freer divorce and lip service to  equality all over the place.</p> <p>In other ways they remain strictly limited:  no fundamental change in the division of  labour in the home, no equal pay in reality,  women still hugely underrepresented in  top jobs, sexist images all over the media. Of course the change is not evenly spread  across society. In my judgement the least  has been at the very top among those who  own the wealth and control the state. There, bourgeois male power remains  firmly entrenched. The biggest change has  been among the professional middle  classes--academics, intellectuals, media  people, etc--where the success of girls in  education and higher education has had its  effect and equal opportunities policies  abound.</p> <p>Many working class women have also benefited  from the changes, from the shift in  general attitudes and the increased educational  and job opportunities. But for the  majority, especially in the manual as  opposed to white collar working class,  where money for child care is scarce or  nonexistent and the struggle for survival  dominates, the change has been minimal. Some working class men, in the main the  politically more progressive, have changed  their attitudes, but many have not and the  old sexism remains rampant. The problems  are particularly acute among teenagers and  young men anxious to establish their  virility, and this is what working class girls  and young women have to cope with.</p> <p>These are the contradictions which Emin  has lived and which her art expresses and  responds to with clarity and passion. Politically there is an obvious problem in  that while Emin's work ultimately carries a  message of hope, it is hope for an individual  not a collective or social solution,  and this can only be possible for a small  minority. Unfortunately we don't get our  art to political order and given the historical  period of Emin's artistic formation, the  1980s and early 1990s, it is hardly surprising  that collective working class  emancipation through political action was  not high on her agenda. What matters  more than the correct politics is whether  the problems addressed are real, whether  the art has integrity and whether it is visually  imaginative and powerful. Emin's work  succeeds on all these counts with the extra  factor that it really speaks to people, and  people beyond the normal range of 'art  lovers', in a way that is achieved by no  other contemporary artist.</p>","Yes"

run, as he put it: \""at the \""intersection of urgent need and lasting impact."", ""\""That question generated more than 46,000 responses on Twitter, leaving Bezos with another issue."", ""How to sort and weigh all that feedback?"", ""Louis Rosenberg, the founder of Silicon Valley-based Unanimous AI had an answer, and decided to show it off using Bezos's responses."", ""Rosenberg and his company specialize in a form of advanced decision making called swarm intelligence, basically a computer-enhanced way to get humans to communicate like honeybees do in nature, by tapping into the experiences of large groups of individuals to make the most complete community decision possible."", ""In the name of social progress-and certainly some self-promotion-Rosenberg turned his tech on Bezos's information-overload problem."", ""It took some tricky methodology and lots of processing power inside a customized platform, but the result was rather surprising."", ""Turns out, Americans feel most strongly about things like cancer treatment assistance, cheaper medicine, and mobile health clinics.Some of those things might be personally driven: It seems like everyone knows someone whose life has been touched by cancer, and huge swaths of America don't have affordable access to healthcare or decent nearby services."", ""Ultimately, however Rosenberg's simulated swarm unanimously picked a basic and fundamental issue for Bezos to focus on: universal access to clean drinking water.It's the universality of that issue that Rosenberg finds interesting."", ""While concerns about water safety continue to grow in the U.S. (lead contamination likely goes far beyond Flint, Michigan), access to safe, readily available water remains a critical issue in the developing world, as well."", ""\""A swarm by their very nature encourages a group to find the places where they agree,\"" says Rosenberg."", ""\""And as a result they tend to find the solutions that are best for the greater good as opposed to forming factions that are defending their own interests.\"""", ""More data shows that nearly everyone ended up happy and confident in that answer.Most artificial intelligence systems set out to mimic and improve neurological intelligence, using sets of algorithms and machine learning to solve challenges with more processing power at greater speeds than humans are capable."", ""That's prompted fears (and a well-known movie franchise) about sentient beings becoming self-aware.Despite its sci-fi sounding name, though, an artificial hive mind keeps humans at the center of each transaction."", ""\""Instead of just being a system of neurons where intelligence emerges,\"" says Rosenberg, \""swarm intelligence is a system of organisms where super intelligence emerges."", ""\""Take bees, for instance."", ""Individually, they aren't very smart."", ""But bees don't think on their own when it comes to important decisions."", ""Instead, each bee shares what information it has about a certain scenario through vibrations with the group, allowing the swarm to decide, in real time, based on lots of feedback, what action might be best for collective survival.Same goes for birds that flock, fish that school, and ants that assemble into colonies."", ""\""They're smarter together,\"" Rosenberg says."", ""\""It's about enabling groups of organisms to be connected in real time with feedback loops so that they can converge on optimal solutions and they can basically amplify their intelligence."", ""\""Unanimous's technology mimics that process, using a platform called Unu, an online community managed by the company that works a lot like a virtual Ouija board."", ""It generally asks one question, with six answers arranged at different points around a hexagonal ring."", ""In the center of the ring there is a translucent, circular puck, which online participants on the company's platform can tug with their cursor toward whatever answer they deem the best.Those people may be located all over the U.S., but each cursor is represented on a shared screen by a tiny magnet icon, so that as the puck moves toward one answer or another, those within the swarm can see where the decision might be headed, and where others are trying to pull it."", ""If there's another solution they might prefer to the pending outcome that seems to also have a lot of support, they can shift their alliance, tugging the puck in that direction.Since it was launched in 2015, Unanimous AI has used its \""wisdom of crowds\"" process most for easily quantifiable problem solving: In 2016, its \""Swarm AI\"" process predicted far more Oscar winners (11 of 15 categories) than polled moviegoers or even top critics."", ""It has also beaten legions of traditional gamblers when placing Vegas-style bets on the Super Bowl (68% of all prop bets paid off)."", ""In fact, one month before Bezos's charity advice tweet, Unanimous AI correctly called the top four finishers in the Kentucky Derby for an extremely rare superfecta, turning Rosenberg's promotional $20 bet into about $11,000.In swarming, the options always max out at six to avoid confusion known as \""choice overload.\"""", ""Twitter didn't cough up six ideas though-it offered tens of thousands.To vet the submissions, Unanimous created a simple language filter, grouping repetitive ideas that shared similar themes into a smaller set of 200 different suggestions."", ""Next, the group asked 300 volunteers to grade each idea on a scale of 1 to 10, based on Bezos's critera."", ""Proposals with a cumulative average of at least 7 or higher moved on for final consideration leaving a field of 25 potential solutions.From there, Unanimous began a process of elimination game inside their platform."", ""They asked 100 users on Unu to review the 25 remaining ideas in batches of 6, tugging the puck toward whichever the community thought would be least helpful."", ""The system deleted the loser, reshuffled the five survivors, and began the process of elimination again, until, eventually, the pool was reduce to six finalists: cancer treatment assistance, universal access to clean drinking water, mobile health clinics, free medicine for the poor, essential equipment for rural hospitals, and health clinics for the poor.Once the six finalists were chosen, Unu offered a direct question to the swarm: \""Which should we recommend Bezos focus his philanthropy?\"""", ""The swarm took about 10 seconds to tug the puck toward their decision: universal access to clean drinking water.As you can see in the animation below, water equality wasn't necessarily everyone's first choice, but as the puck began to move, it became far favorable than some others on the board, which lead to an acceptable group decision.Afterward, Unanimous generated a factional analysis to highlight how allegiances shifted during the tug of war."", ""Nearly everyone appears to have quickly reconciled that clean water was important."", ""Based on some internal math that accounts the zigs-and-zags, Unanimous estimates that the swarm is 85% confident in its answer.To ensure that the decision met all

direct his future philanthropy, a company that specializes in harnessing the wisdom of crowds used their tech to find consensus on how the world thinks the Amazon founder should donate his billions.</p> <p>""A swarm by their very nature encourages a group to find the places where they agree."" [Photo: Mike Kane/Bloomberg/Getty Images]</p> <p>With a net worth of $86 billion, Jeff Bezos certainly has enough money to change the world. What he's lacked, apparently, was some direction for how to spend it. In mid-June, the Amazon founder tweeted a ""request for ideas"" worth philanthropically investing in that would help society, both short-term-""here and now""-and in the long run, as he put it: ""at the ""intersection of urgent need and lasting impact. ""That question generated more than 46,000 responses on Twitter, leaving Bezos with another issue. How to sort and weigh all that feedback? Louis Rosenberg, the founder of Silicon Valley-based Unanimous AI had an answer, and decided to show it off using Bezos's responses. Rosenberg and his company specialize in a form of advanced decision making called swarm intelligence, basically a computer-enhanced way to get humans to communicate like honeybees do in nature, by tapping into the experiences of large groups of individuals to make the most complete community decision possible. In the name of social progress-and certainly some self-promotion-Rosenberg turned his tech on Bezos's information-overload problem. It took some tricky methodology and lots of processing power inside a customized platform, but the result was rather surprising. Turns out, Americans feel most strongly about things like cancer treatment assistance, cheaper medicine, and mobile health clinics.Some of those things might be personally driven: It seems like everyone knows someone whose life has been touched by cancer, and huge swaths of America don't have affordable access to healthcare or decent nearby services. Ultimately, however Rosenberg's simulated swarm unanimously picked a basic and fundamental issue for Bezos to focus on: universal access to clean drinking water.It's the universality of that issue that Rosenberg finds interesting. While concerns about water safety continue to grow in the U.S. (lead contamination likely goes far beyond Flint, Michigan), access to safe, readily available water remains a critical issue in the developing world, as well. ""A swarm by their very nature encourages a group to find the places where they agree,"" says Rosenberg. ""And as a result they tend to find the solutions that are best for the greater good as opposed to forming factions that are defending their own interests."" More data shows that nearly everyone ended up happy and confident in that answer.Most artificial intelligence systems set out to mimic and improve neurological intelligence, using sets of algorithms and machine learning to solve challenges with more processing power at greater speeds than humans are capable. That's prompted fears (and a well-known movie franchise) about sentient beings becoming self-aware.Despite its sci-fi sounding name, though, an artificial hive mind keeps humans at the center of each transaction. ""Instead of just being a system of neurons where intelligence emerges,"" says Rosenberg, ""swarm intelligence is a system of organisms where super intelligence emerges. ""Take bees, for instance. Individually, they aren't very smart. But bees don't think on their own when it comes to important decisions. Instead, each bee shares what information it has about a certain scenario through vibrations with the group, allowing the swarm to decide, in real time, based on lots of feedback, what action might be best for collective survival.Same goes for birds that flock, fish that school, and ants that assemble into colonies. ""They're smarter together,"" Rosenberg says. ""It's about enabling groups of organisms to be connected in real time with feedback loops so that they can converge on optimal solutions and they can basically amplify their intelligence. ""Unanimous's technology mimics that process, using a platform called Unu, an online community managed by the company that works a lot like a virtual Ouija board. It generally asks one question, with six answers arranged at different points around a hexagonal ring. In the center of the ring there is a translucent, circular puck, which online participants on the company's platform can tug with their cursor toward whatever answer they deem the best.Those people may be located all over the U.S., but each cursor is represented on a shared screen by a tiny magnet icon, so that as the puck moves toward one answer or another, those within the swarm can see where the decision might be headed, and where others are trying to pull it. If there's another solution they might prefer to the pending outcome that seems to also have a lot of support, they can shift their alliance, tugging the puck in that direction.Since it was launched in 2015, Unanimous AI has used its ""wisdom of crowds"" process most for easily quantifiable problem solving: In 2016, its ""Swarm AI"" process predicted far more Oscar winners (11 of 15 categories) than polled moviegoers or even top critics. It has also beaten legions of traditional gamblers when placing Vegas-style bets on the Super Bowl (68% of all prop bets paid off). In fact, one month before Bezos's charity advice tweet, Unanimous AI correctly called the top four finishers in the Kentucky Derby for an extremely rare superfecta, turning Rosenberg's promotional $20 bet into about $11,000.In swarming, the options always max out at six to avoid confusion known as ""choice overload."" Twitter didn't cough up six ideas though-it offered tens of thousands.To vet the submissions, Unanimous created a simple language filter, grouping repetitive ideas that shared similar themes into a smaller set of 200 different suggestions. Next, the group asked 300 volunteers to grade each idea on a scale of 1 to 10, based on Bezos's critera. Proposals with a cumulative average of at least 7 or higher moved on for final consideration leaving a field of 25 potential solutions.From there, Unanimous began a process of elimination game inside their platform. They asked 100 users on Unu to review the 25 remaining ideas in batches of 6, tugging the puck toward whichever the community thought would be least helpful. The system deleted the loser, reshuffled the five survivors, and began the process of elimination again, until, eventually, the pool was reduce to six finalists: cancer treatment assistance, universal access to clean drinking water, mobile health clinics, free medicine for the poor, essential equipment for rural hospitals, and health clinics for the poor.Once the six finalists were chosen, Unu offered a direct question to the swarm: ""Which should we recommend Bezos focus his philanthropy?"" The swarm took about 10 seconds to tug the puck toward their decision: universal access to clean drinking water.As you can see in the animation below, water equality wasn't necessarily everyone's first choice, but as the puck began to move, it became far favorable than some others on the board, which lead to an acceptable group decision.Afterward, Unanimous generated a factional analysis to highlight how allegiances shifted during the tug of war. Nearly everyone appears to have quickly reconciled that clean water was important. Based on some internal math that accounts the zigs-and-zags, Unanimous estimates that the swarm is 85% confident in its answer.To ensure that the decision met all of Bezos's criteria, Rosenberg rephrased that question and ran other swarms, focusing specifically on which solution might be the most urgent, have lasting impact, and affect the most people. Each time, though, drinking water topped out.The swarm's decision for Bezos to tackle water rights, perhaps against its own immediate self-interest for cheaper meds or a cancer breakthrough, parallels research that shows how swarms often perform far better than disconnected individuals in ""tragedy of the commons"" scenarios, which tempt people to take more than a fair share of some potential community windfall, with the risk that if too many people get greedy everyone might get nothing.In second place is health clinics for the poor, followed by free medicine for the poor, and then cancer treatment assistance. Further down, concepts like a free online university, providing glasses to poor children, legal help for domestic abuse victims, purchasing drug patents to lower costs, and ""earn while learning"" jobs programs all made the list.Whether Bezos is actually taking the responses to his tweet to heart remains to be seen, but if it was an attempt at coming to some sort of democratic decisions about his future philanthropy, he now has his answer.</p>","Yes"

Beach chairs and pillows are scattered around the floor, with  occasional coolers of free beer and soda. Free hot dogs are available from a sidewalk vendor before the show begins. All four walls show a different continuous video feed, and the live band is set up in the corner.</p> <p>It's  within  a very comfortable, very casual space  that the play unfolds at a leisurely pace. Live  performance  being  a small part of the whole,  most of the  ""action"" takes place on the video screens. The live actors pick their way through the crowd as they perform and  the musicians have small roles as well. Each scene, both live and video, is only a few minutes long  at most. In its entirety,  involves 108 artists-- including a Tuvan throat singer, drag queens and a freak clown.</p> <p>At its core, however, the  work  is about relationships and the frailty and fickleness of human emotion. Every person is in some stage of a relationship. Some of  these  relationships are just beginning, some are ending, some are in that awkward place just before ending, and some will never happen at all. The delicate ecosystem of the humans informs that of this barrier island. Fire Island itself is a character since  much of the video feeds  are shots of boardwalks, tall grasses, the beach, the waves, the sky, all the parts of  what  makes  this  such a popular summer destination.</p> <p>succeeds where Mee's last production,  at Signature Theater, failed. While  this, like  other  Mee plays   also  involved multimedia aspects,  it  seemed little more than a jumble of ideas and characters. While   also  contains  its own  jumble of characters, the production is lithe and erudite, and  somehow  more than the sum of its parts. The nontraditional seating and atmosphere, and no doubt  the free beer,  keeps the audience relaxed and engaged as  they   probably would  not be  in a more formal, traditional setting.</p> <p>To  this   fan of Mee's work,  is a rare marriage of material and production which director Kevin Cunningham weaves into an exuberant whole.</p>","No"

Norway has protested against the move - the first time that a Nobel Peace Prize has been confiscated by national authorities - and compared the treatment of Ms Ebadi with that of the Burmese opposition leader, Aung San Su Kyi. Born in 1947 in the city of Hamadan, Ms Ebadi studied law at Tehran University before beginning a career as a judge in 1970. Within five years she became a president of the Tehran city court, the first woman in Iranian history to be appointed to the position.

After several attempts, Ms Ebadi went on to establish a law practice in 1992, taking on the kind of sensitive cases many Iranian lawyers would touch, challenging the authorities on anything from human rights and freedom of expression to their interpretation of Islam. Two of her clients, liberal intellectuals Daryoush and Parvaneh Forouhar, were stabbed to death in a series of killings in 1998 which turned out to be the work of ""rogue elements"" in the Intelligence Ministry. She also defended women's rights activists. The lawyer found herself in the dock in 2000, accused of distributing the video-taped confession of a hardline hooligan who claimed that prominent conservative leaders were instigating physical attacks on pro-reform gatherings and figures. That won her a suspended jail sentence and a professional ban. She also wrote books calling for greater legal protection for Iranian children. In 2003, the Nobel award committee awarded Ms Ebadi its Peace Prize, saying she had been chosen because ""as a lawyer, judge, lecturer, writer and activist, she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country, Iran, and far beyond"".</p> <p>The Nobel Committee paid tribute to Ms Ebadi for her courage in 2003</p> <p>The committee also paid tribute to her courage, noting that she had ""never heeded the threat to her own safety"". After the award was announced, Ms Ebadi told the BBC that she thought it would give people who worked for human rights in Iran more courage. Ms Ebadi has since continued to defend prominent political prisoners, journalists, students and women in Iran, and has repeated her calls for reform. In 2006, she published a memoir, Iran Awakening, which was unable to pass the censors inside Iran but was well received internationally. ""In the last 23 years, from the day I was stripped of my judgeship to the years of doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith,"" she wrote. ""It is not religion that binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within, has underpinned my work."" Ms Ebadi left Iran for a conference the day before President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election and has not returned since. She says she has been sent ""threatening messages"" warning her to stop working for human rights and calling for reform, while her husband was recently arrested in Tehran and ""severely beaten"". She has nevertheless criticised the authorities for their suppression of opposition protests, and urged the international community to reject the outcome and called for a new election monitored by the UN.</p>","Yes"

I was to meet her in the state capital of what is officially known as America's sunshine state, but is more widely regarded as America's weirdest state. Ebadi was in Florida for PeaceJam, which connects Nobel peace prize laureates with youth. But I found it hard to imagine the greatest Iranian human rights icon spending Persian New Year week at a teen camp on the Florida panhandle. ""I go everywhere, I live on planes,"" she tells me on the phone and indeed days later I'm scheduled to meet her closer to my home in New York City.</p> <p>On the phone I hold my breath every time we speak - her informal, easy Persian contrasts with mine, layered with too much cloying etiquette, the kind you prepare for some relative of your dreams.

I consider the prospect of translating Persian for those trapped in legalese at airports during the ""Muslim ban"", and I don't trust my tongue.</p> <p>Ebadi dismisses my apologies and sticks to our logistics. I foolishly suggest a Persian restaurant in midtown Manhattan frequented by my circle of Iranian journalists and she, with a swift correction reminds me of her security concerns. Would I instead mind coming over to New Jersey where she is staying with family? Hoboken, have I heard of it? It's she who tells me how close it is to Manhattan. I've lived in New York City for over 20 years, but rarely spent much time in New Jersey. And she asks about my texting abilities, and I numbly consider my phone which confuses me more often than not. I am months shy of 40, I try to explain to someone months shy of 70. ""It'll be easy,"" she insists. It's not the first time she tells me that in our conversations.</p> <p>If Tallahassee was an unlikely place to meet, Hoboken is the only slightly less unlikely rival.

She doesn't look the least bit out of place, but she's perhaps not convinced of me. ""Okay, can you walk a few blocks? Let's get to work!""</p> <p>We end up in a Starbucks of all places, which Ebadi says works well for meetings - anonymous, casual, yet quiet enough for our purposes. But it's wildly crowded on this Sunday morning and most of our conversation has to happen over Elton John and Buffalo Springfield as baristas bellow the debased Italian of the American coffee lexicon. At one point, I express to Ebadi my worry about our speaking loudly in Farsi - the overheated Islamophobia recently, I try to warn. But her shrug says it all. Ebadi is someone who has done considerable time in all sorts of dangers.</p> <p>The first time Ebadi came deep into my consciousness was autumn 2003, just over half a year after the US went to war in Iraq, not even two years since president George W Bush declared Iran part of the ""Axis of Evil"". Amid all this, Ebadi won the Nobel peace prize. I was in graduate school at Johns Hopkins and the last thing on mind was any sort of Iranian pride, but I'll never forget that phone call from my father: ""Best news! Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel!"" We celebrated as if she were a cousin.</p> <p>And she might be, my family would always try to insist, as Ebadi comes from Hamadan where my mother was from. A year after Ebadi's birth there in 1947, her family moved to Tehran. They encouraged her to get her law degree and by 1970 she was one of the first female judges in Iran.</p> <p>""The luck I had was that I was born into a very good family. We were three daughters and one brother. All the freedoms my brother had, I had. There was no difference between us. My father loved my mother very much. He was a real feminist - I learned feminist principles from my father really. They were Muslim and they practiced very modern Islam. And we went to Zoroastrian school. Why did we? Because it was a good school near us and my father said there is no reason to go far to go to another good school. He said all religions are one. And I learned from my family to respect all religions.""</p> <p>Not even 30, she became the youngest and first female chief magistrate of 26th divisional court in Tehran in 1975. By the 1979 Revolution, she was married but she was about to lose her career as female judges were dismissed by the regime. She was demoted to the role of magistrate's clerk in the court over which she once presided, so she requested an early retirement. During this period she wrote articles and worked on books, and tended to her two young daughters. Finally, in 1992, she was able to get a license for a private practice.</p> <p>She soon became the defence lawyer for the most important human rights cases in Iran, including Zahra Kazemi, Parvaneh and Dariush Foroohar, Ezat Ebrahim Nejad, and Zahra Bani Yaghoob. She also defended leaders of the Baha'i faith, the most persecuted religious minority in Iran. And she did this all without making a living from it.</p> <p>""Not only did I not make money, 20 lawyers who worked with us did not make money. We had 6,000 political cases we defended without charge. We decided to take no money. I did consulting in my office, my husband had a job as an engineer, our office was our own so no rent - so with political prisoners I took no pay."" Ebadi falls into a wistful smile when recalling the mother of Kazemi insisting on paying her in limes from Shiraz.</p> <p>Trouble came soon enough: in 1999 she was charged with ""disturbing public opinion"", for which she spent 25 days in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, where she had visited her clients many times. More convictions quickly followed and she was threatened with more imprisonment and a bar on practicing law for five years but due to international pressure her sentence was reduced to a fine.</p> <p>When the Nobel came in 2003, Ebadi was shocked. ""I had no idea I was a candidate. When I found out, I was very surprised. The [prize] money helped me so I could get a good apartment, get some computers in there, and our work really progressed."" She set up an office for what would become a major human rights organisation, the Center for Defenders of Human Rights (CDHR) which supported the families of political prisoners.</p> <p>Trouble came again in 2009. While Ebadi was in Spain for a three-day conference, the Islamic Republic of Iran held its now notorious tenth presidential elections which ended in protests, giving birth to Iran's opposition Green movement. In spite of protests with hundreds of thousands of Iranians in Tehran - and many communities around the world - it ended in house arrest for the movement favourite Mir Hossein Mousavi and all sorts of renewed crackdowns on the Iranian people. The government filed a case against Ebadi in the revolutionary court and confiscated her properties, including the office of the CDHR.</p> <p>Only when Ebadi talks about this can you hear pain in her voice. There is a soft strain in her voice when she details how this led to her current exile in London. ""The reason I did not return is not because I am afraid of jail,"" she says. ""Outside of Iran I knew I'd be more useful. I could speak, I could hear the voices of people."" Do you miss Iran? ""Naturally."" Will you go back one day? ""Definitely.""</p> <p>This is where Ebadi achieves saint-like status for some - to look back on Iran with love would be a feat for many, given what she details in her most recent book Until We Are Free: My Fight For Human Rights in Iran. The book, with startling candour, reveals the story of how the government eventually succeeded in hurting her where it hurt the most: her family. After years of the authorities targeting her daughters and sister, all while harassing Ebadi herself, they resorted to one of their more sinister schemes.</p> <p>Just a couple months after the election, her husband of 35 years disappeared only to finally call her with this story: he had cheated on her and was in Evin. It went deeper than that: he had been set up in a sting operation involving video cameras, a mistress, and alcohol. The presence of alcohol plus the fact that in Islamic law sex outside of marriage is forbidden, gave authorities free reign to take him to prison where he was lashed, convicted of adultery and sentenced to death. He narrowly escaped execution by making a deal with authorities - publicly denouncing Ebadi in return for freedom: ""Shirin Ebadi did not deserve to receive the Nobel Prize. She was awarded the prize so that she could help topple the Islamic Republic. She is a supporter of the west, particularly America. Her work is not in the service of Iranians, but serves the interests of foreign imperialists who seek to weaken Iran."" Ebadi stayed abroad in London and their marriage dissolved, though amicably - her entire family understood that they had been framed.</p> <p>I'm tempted to dance around the details - even as a journalist, it's daunting to ask an Iranian elder such intimate specifics - but Ebadi insists on telling her story. ""The reason I told the story so openly was that I wanted to show what the government in Iran is capable of. They have done what they did to my husband to many others. But more so, the talk of this in Iran is taboo, and I wanted to break the taboo. A government who can whip me on streets if strands of hair are revealed, and hires a sex worker for politics in the name of Islam?"" The hint of distress in her throat immediately burns into triumph. ""So, yes, I have my priorities when it comes to taboo.""</p> <p>Ebadi has detailed all her paths and the many obstacles in several books and counting, the most famous being Iran Awakening: One Woman's Journey to Reclaim Her Life and Country, co-authored with journalist Azadeh Moaveni.</p> <p>""I admire her ferocious integrity and her enduring grip on what matters most to Iranian women,"" says Moaveni. ""She doesn't always say the most fashionable things, or shift her beliefs to suit the funding currents in Washington, because she is so above that, always has been. The price of that has been a smaller share of the limelight than she really deserves. She doesn't cut deals with justice and it is because of that I find her so precious.""</p> <p>It's no wonder then that by the end of our several hours together, I find myself asking her for advice. How, I wonder, can an activist survive this world? ""Back in Tehran, always before bed, I would always read literature,"" she says. ""Unfortunately abroad I don't have the same access to [translated] books, so I watch films. And comic films only. Before sleeping I have to for a half hour loudly laugh and this helps me so much. It frees my mind.""</p> <p>I mentally bookmark this under essential self-care, but, as the Starbucks soundtrack goes from the Bruce Springsteen of my youth to the Lauryn Hill of my early adult years, I find myself inconsolably touching down to anxieties about Islamophobia in America. ""There is a system here, but in Iran there is no system,"" she says, while acknowledging some situations are analogous. ""The state and the citizen are very different. The government can be bad but the people are not like that. And this is why there are tensions in society. Because the culture of the people is higher than the culture of the government."" And this could be the entire Middle East and now America with its own fledgling dictatorship.</p> <p>""Almost a fourth of the people on this Earth are Muslim,"" she continues. ""And there are so many countries of the world where the majority are Muslim. Are they like each other? Of course not. But some of the countries only show the dark Islam. In this America, we have some great professors of Islamic studies, but no one knows them. But Bin Laden everyone knows!""</p> <p>And what of all the debates around feminism and Islam in this country? ""Women must be free,"" Ebadi says, without pause. ""For example, why don't we bother with men's beards but we do with the woman's hijab? Because their beards, that's Islam too. The hijab should be a choice.""</p> <p>I wander further into advice and ask her what we should tell young people, thinking about the students I teach who are extremely depressed. ""It's very important to make young people interested in issues of social justice and politics. Tell them, this is your destiny, this is your life, don't be let it go by. It's not enough just to vote - after that you must see if those you voted for went through with your decisions. If they did not, then you must protest! I give an example: democracy is like a flower. You must give it water and sun daily. You can't pour enough water for a month at once. Democracy needs daily maintenance."" It's anecdote she's told many times, one I won't soon forget.</p> <p>At the end of our time together, I come to feel like she is my family. She is helping me download Telegram so she can send me films about recent prisoners in Iran (""you must go to the app store!"" she snaps, as I fumble with my phone), all while she shows me pictures of her five-year-old grandson.</p> <p>We leave the American anthems of the Starbucks behind and walk toward the waterfront, talking work and love. ""I love what I do,"" she tells me. ""The more I progressed, my interest in my work only grew. I must do it all.

""For me this is my fourth skate with my team...still getting to know names and face. This will be a good couple of preseason games for us to figure everything out.""</p> <p>""Over the summer I've really worked on my foot speed a lot. I'm almost trying to learn how to use it when I'm playing. Just getting comfortable driving to the hard areas and the net,"" she explained. ""I think the main thing about these games is really trying to execute the systems that our coach has put forward cuz we'll be successful if we buy in,"" she added later.</p> <p>Rafter also took a moment to talk about the culture she had entered:</p> <p>'These are the best couple practices I've ever had as a player. It's just really run like a professional practice. One thing to next. Little teaching moments and then moving on. Chad really does a real good job of treating us like professionals. It's maintaining that focus and just being able to commit to a full practice. That really translates into the game when you know there is these expectations and everything Is laid out for you. Then we have a plan that we can trust. Then it's up to us when it comes to a game.""</p> <p>The Riveters faced Russia the following day as well.</p> <p>Noticed Plays. (An attempt to note what might not appear on the score sheet. This is by no means exhaustive. Format is a work in progress.)</p> <p>Amanda Kessel had at least one defensively and also swung outside of Russia's zone to steal it and bring it back.</p> <p>Bray Ketchum stole the biscuit at center ice and skated into the Russia zone, Tatiana Rafter snatched it in the Riveters zone and also to start an offensive drive in Russia's end. Morgan Fritz-Ward also acquired it in the opposing zone. Rebecca Morse stole it in the Russian end, as did Rebecca Russo who produced a shot from her efforts.</p> <p>Courtney Burke stole and brought the puck up ice, Kiira Dosdall grabbed it in her zone and moved it out and Gabie Figueroa had a steal in the Riveters end.</p> <p>Kiira Dosdall got to a loose puck in the New York end and moved it along.</p> <p>Ashley Johnston disrupted at least 3 zone entries and Morgan Fritz-Ward at least one.</p> <p>Amanda Kessel had at least 2, Michelle Picard, Kiira Dosdall had at least one.</p> <p>One of Morgan Fritz-Ward's blocks led to a break, and later another she brought out as well. She also repeated the maneuver and fed it up to Janine Weber for a rush.</p> <p>Intercepted Passes: Rebecca Morse intercepted a Russian pass in the defensive zone, Janine Weber got in the way at mid ice of another visitor effort and Alexa Gruschow knocked a puck down to acquire it.</p> <p>Michelle Picard keep the puck in the Russia zone at least three times during the evening prolonging the attack.</p> <p>Kaleigh Fratkin got in close and launched a solid shot on the power play. Julia Herr got the puck near the keeper and sent it in then Miye D'Oench for a shot. Bray Ketchum produced a good opportunity in front as well. Kiira Dosdall had two shots as one was immediately blocked but she shot it again on net.</p> <p>At different times, Courtney Burke kept it in the zone on the power play.</p> <p>Janine Weber stole the puck from behind the net as the goalie played it.</p> <p>Miye D'Oench and Julia Herr put major pressure on the Russia defense.</p> <p>Morgan Fritz-Ward blocked a shot and brought the puck out with Janine Weber.</p> <p>Amanda Kessel and Courtney Burke each had clears at various points.</p> <p>Fritz-Ward and Kessel each brought the puck out directly at other times.</p> <p>Alexa Gruschow had a few steals as part of the effort.</p> <p>Mariia Batalova brought it in, Alevtina Shtareva had break, as did Anna Shokhina. Nina Pirogova kept the puck in the Riveters end for another opportunity.</p> <p>Mariia Batalova intercepted a Riveters pass. Anna Shokhina stole a puck which eventually lead to possession sequence for Russia. Elena Podkamennaia had a steal in the Russia zone that she took it all the way down for a chance and Ekaterina Lobova disrupted a pass.</p> <p>Ekaterina Smolentseva had a block, Olga Sosina blocked a shot and Angelina Goncharenko had a block on the power kill.</p> <p>When the puck got through the goalie's pads and creeped towards the goal line Angelina Goncharenko kept it out of the net.</p> <p>Elena Podkamennaia cleared the puck at one point, Anna Shibanova eventually cleared it at another point and Ekaterina Smolentseva got it out of the Russia zone at a different time.</p> <p>Nina Pirogova had at least 2 penalty kill clears, Mariia Batalova, Ekaterina Lobova, Olga Sosina, Iya Gavrilova had at least one.</p> <p>This site doesn't follow a pattern.

Santa Cruz's unconventional ways and personal touch, the faculty on Monday rejected a proposal to end the requirement that professors write paragraph-long evaluations of each student in class."", ""The faculty already has agreed to institute mandatory grades, beginning next fall."", ""Students and alumni worried that eliminating written performance evaluations, on top of starting to use A-F letter grades, would rob the campus of a distinct spirit that fosters learning for learning's sake.Until now, most students have taken courses on a pass/not pass basis, relying on the narratives to give them more precise feedback.Santa Cruz was a rare place, they said, where students asked professors about the subject matter, not what's heard most frequently on other campuses: \""Will this be on the final exam?"", ""\""Ending written evaluations, students argued, would have removed another distinction: the need for professors to get to know their students--at least well enough to write short narratives about them."", ""\""Only UCSC was gifted with the nongrading system,\"" a 1970 graduate recently wrote."", ""\""Otherwise, UCSC is just another cookie-cutter college that happens to be surrounded with redwoods."", ""\""Professors advocating the status quo prevailed Monday in a voice vote of the faculty's governing body, the Academic Senate."", ""That vote could be appealed to a vote-by-mail of the senate's full membership of 600 professors, if the full senate chooses."", ""\""The policy remains the same,\"" said campus spokeswoman Elizabeth Irwin."", ""\""It was not a close vote."", ""\""But the senate restated that the professors have wide leeway to determine what's covered in the evaluations."", ""It also called for reformatting transcripts to make them shorter and getting professors more technological help.Such written evaluations, said linguistics professor Bill Ladusaw, \""needn't be a massive task."", ""There are lots of ways of automating these things."", ""\""A growing number of faculty members have complained that the narratives have become an onerous chore as the campus has grown from a cozy alternative college of 5,000 students to a burgeoning research university expected to soon enroll 15,000 students.What makes the system more burdensome, the professors argue, is that besides nearly tripling the size of the student body, the student-faculty ratio has more than doubled--from 9-1 to nearly 19-1.It's difficult to get to know more than a handful of students in a big lecture class, some professors say.They say narrative evaluations, often written by teaching assistants, have become formulaic, paragraphs of boilerplate language that correspond to a particular grade."", ""\""We believe the faculty's time is better

Formerly a professor of mathematics there, she has retired to become a professor emeritus.","At Santa Cruz, Schonbek advocated replacing the campus's system of narrative evaluations of student performance in each course with the more standard system of letter grades used at most other US universities.","<p>YOU ARE HERE:</p> <p>To the relief of students who love UC Santa Cruz's unconventional ways and personal touch, the faculty on Monday rejected a proposal to end the requirement that professors write paragraph-long evaluations of each student in class. The faculty already has agreed to institute mandatory grades, beginning next fall. Students and alumni worried that eliminating written performance evaluations, on top of starting to use A-F letter grades, would rob the campus of a distinct spirit that fosters learning for learning's sake.Until now, most students have taken courses on a pass/not pass basis, relying on the narratives to give them more precise feedback.Santa Cruz was a rare place, they said, where students asked professors about the subject matter, not what's heard most frequently on other campuses: ""Will this be on the final exam? ""Ending written evaluations, students argued, would have removed another distinction: the need for professors to get to know their students--at least well enough to write short narratives about them. ""Only UCSC was gifted with the nongrading system,"" a 1970 graduate recently wrote. ""Otherwise, UCSC is just another cookie-cutter college that happens to be surrounded with redwoods. ""Professors advocating the status quo prevailed Monday in a voice vote of the faculty's governing body, the Academic Senate. That vote could be appealed to a vote-by-mail of the senate's full membership of 600 professors, if the full senate chooses. ""The policy remains the same,"" said campus spokeswoman Elizabeth Irwin. ""It was not a close vote. ""But the senate restated that the professors have wide leeway to determine what's covered in the evaluations. It also called for reformatting transcripts to make them shorter and getting professors more technological help.Such written evaluations, said linguistics professor Bill Ladusaw, ""needn't be a massive task. There are lots of ways of automating these things. ""A growing number of faculty members have complained that the narratives have become an onerous chore as the campus has grown from a cozy alternative college of 5,000 students to a burgeoning research university expected to soon enroll 15,000 students.What makes the system more burdensome, the professors argue, is that besides nearly tripling the size of the student body, the student-faculty ratio has more than doubled--from 9-1 to nearly 19-1.It's difficult to get to know more than a handful of students in a big lecture class, some professors say.They say narrative evaluations, often written by teaching assistants, have become formulaic, paragraphs of boilerplate language that correspond to a particular grade. ""We believe the faculty's time is better spent by focusing on the letters of recommendations rather than writing evaluations for each student,"" wrote Manfred Warmuth, a computer scientist, and Maria Schonbek, a mathematician.But other professors, adherents to Santa Cruz's tradition, prevailed by arguing that even boilerplate evaluations are better than impersonal grades.

Of those 5 types, Plasmodium falciparum is the one that most commonly causes severe disease in patients that are not immune to the disease. It can then develop within a few days to a very severe condition affecting many vital organs, for instance the brain, causing coma or cerebral malaria; it can affect kidneys causing renal failure and lungs causing respiratory failure; it can make the blood very acidotic and causes severe anaemia as well as death. So then it is really an emergency disease.</p> <p>Q: Is malaria different in South East Asia than Africa, and is it different in Cambodia and Thailand?</p> <p>AD: Yes there are differences between sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in that the transmission of the disease in Africa is much more intense than in Asia. In many parts of Africa a child gets bitten once a day or sometimes even several times a day by an infected mosquito which transmits the malaria parasite. If that child doesn't die from the disease they will build up immunity in the first years of their lives, so you hardly see any severe disease after the age of five. Whereas in Asia people are bitten maybe once a year by an infected mosquito so they don't have time to build up immunity. There you see disease in young adults or in any ages. This also makes the manifestations of the disease slightly different in adults: adults can develop cerebral malaria and very acidotic blood, but also renal failure, pulmonary failure whereas children also often develop coma and acidosis but tend to have more severe anaemia than adult patients. Then your question whether it is specifically different in Cambodia and Thailand: these are areas of low transmission so severe malaria is mainly a disease of young adults; but anti-malarial drug resistance tends to somehow, for reasons we don't completely understand, start in that part of the world. So the treatment of malaria is in general more difficult in that part of the world.</p> <p>Q: What are the most important lines of research that have developed over the last five or ten years?</p> <p>AD: There is a lot of research going on in severe malaria and we more and more understand the mechanisms of the disease - or why a child or an adult gets so severely ill from malaria. The focus is much more around deaths. The real changes are in the smallest blood vessels of the patients because they get completely clogged with these red blood cells that have the mature forms of the parasite; those red blood cells get very sticky and adhere to the lining of the small blood vessels causing a mechanical blockage of blood flow there. This also activates the endothelium which has a lot of secondary effects. Therapies are directed to either kill the parasite at an early stage so that it cannot mature, get sticky and obstruct the small blood vessels, and there are new therapies called adjuvant therapies that you give in addition to anti-malarial drugs which specifically target this mechanism of cyto-adherence?</p> <p>Q: What are the most promising treatments?</p> <p>AD: Our own research over the last few years has been in more potent acting anti-malarial drugs killing young parasites and these are the artemisinin drugs. We tested a specific derivative of those drugs called artesunate that you can give directly into the blood stream. That has proven to be very successful for the treatment of severe malaria. We have done very large trials and shown that in adults with severe malaria it reduces mortality by 35% compared to the old treatment with quinine and in children, African children with severe malaria, by 23%. So that's a huge gain.</p> <p>Q: Why does your line of research matter? Why should we put money into it?</p> <p>AD: Malaria is still a very important disease; malaria control has been very successful over the last decade and malaria mortality worldwide has gone down. But still almost a million people, mainly African children, die from malaria each year so it is a very important disease. We still need better treatments to reduce this high mortality rate and there are still important questions to answer in the mechanism of disease that we need to know in order to develop these better treatments.</p> <p>Q: How does your research fit into translational medicine within the department?</p> <p>AD: Well there are many translational aspects to the research we do. A lot of the research starts in the laboratory trying to look for new treatments in models, and then those new drugs have to be tested out in the field. Once they are shown to work, they need to be translated in the field in which they are really used. Then it is important to get them into guidelines such as the WHO guidelines for treatment of severe malaria - for instance with these new artesunate drugs. What is also important is that the general care of children and adults with severe malaria is improved. We also have teaching programmes to have structured implementation of strategies that are cost effective and cheap so that they can be used in resource poor settings. And with all those mechanisms we have to improve the survival of these people with severe malaria.</p>","No"

""I remember going blank for a moment before excitedly shouting 'yes'.""</p> <p>And just like that, Akello was a month after that encounter flown out of the country on a three-year modelling contract with the agency.</p> <p>""My three-year modelling contract prohibits me from having direct contact with any clients,"" she explains. She does not have a particular schedule as she is called any time for either castings or bookings.</p> <p>Akello says everything is moving on well save for missing people back home. ""I miss my family and friends and will make time to come back and visit,"" she says.</p> <p>Akello stays in a model house provided by the agency, where basics such as food and transport are all taken care of.</p> <p>Modelling in South Africa is like any other job and everything is done at a professional level, from castings to the production of shows and shoots, whereas in Uganda is it largely pursued as a hobby that does not pay much.</p> <p>Regarding payment, Akello says she works for at least $100 (about Shs290,000) per gig. When she was still here, she says the most she usually expected to be paid for gigs was about Shs150,000, although there were designers who paid her more.</p> <p>""Money has never been enough. But at least what I am getting here can pay bills beyond transport costs,"" she says.</p> <p>The 22-year-old says what she loves most about her career are the opportunities it offers, including travel and meeting different people.</p> <p>Her dream is to grow to supermodel status where she hopes to be able to give back to the fashion industry by helping out aspiring models.</p> <p>Are you done with school?</p> <p>Not yet. By the time I left the country I was studying a two year diploma course in travel and tourism management at Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Wandegeya. I put it on a halt when this opportunity came. I will resume when I get back.</p> <p>Do you suffer any misconceptions because of your career as a model?</p> <p>People think I starve to maintain my body size, which is not the case with me. I am not even on any specific diet. I am naturally slender.</p> <p>Are you in a relationship?</p> <p>Yes, I am in a relationship and would not want to indulge into further details.</p> <p>You can at least tell us whether he is Ugandan or not? Fellow model or not?</p> <p>All I can tell you is that I am in a relationship. I cannot give any more details.</p> <p>Any people who inspire you in the fashion and modelling industry?</p> <p>Something funny about me is that I do not have anyone specific that I look up to. I admire anyone who works hard to get where they want to get, regardless of their profession. Probably what I would add is that I love how Alek Wek (renowned international model from South Sudan) has been persistent in the industry.</p> <p>Any advice to upcoming models?</p> <p>Never give up. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel. And learn to trust God.</p> <p>Any challenges so far?</p> <p>Finding my way around is still a problem. Most times, I have to rely on the map on my phone, asking people on the street and cab drivers.</p> <p>It has also been hard securing a working permit. I haven't yet gotten one myself. I have a working visa, which gives me permission to do specific jobs for a limited period of time, so I am not affected.</p> <p>Other Ugandan models working abroad</p> <p>*Stacey Aamito Lagum based in New York</p> <p>*Patricia Namayirira based in Cape town, South Africa</p> <p>*Munirah Namakula, based in Cape town, South Africa</p> <p>*Lucy Suubi based in Canada</p>","Yes"

On podcasts, the etiquette is still being worked out. The host often launches into an introduction while the guest sits quietly in the same sound booth. A couple of years ago, the co-hosts of a podcast called ""Alias Smith and LeRoi"" began this way, speaking about their guest, the comedian Leslie Jones, as if she were not there. ""This is gonna be kind of a hot one,"" Ali LeRoi said. ""I've been waiting to sit her ass down for a minute,"" Owen Smith said. ""One of the funniest women in the game. """"Funniest comedian in the game,"" Jones interrupted. ""Not just woman. I hate that shit."" End of introduction. Comedians are combatants: they ""kill,"" they ""bomb,"" they ""destroy."" Such bluster can mask insecurity, and Jones had good reason to feel defensive. She was forty-six, and had been a standup comedian for more than a quarter century; her peers respected her, but that respect rarely translated into high-paying gigs. ""I remember some nights where I was, like, 'All right, this comedy shit just ain't working out,' "" she told me recently. ""And not just when I was twenty-five. Like, when I was forty-five."" She was a woman in a field dominated by men, and an African-American in an industry that remained disturbingly segregated. Although she had opened for Katt Williams and Dave Chappelle, acted in movies alongside Ice Cube and Martin Lawrence, recorded a standup special for Showtime, and made several appearances on HBO's ""Def Comedy Jam"" and BET's ""ComicView,"" she worried that the gatekeepers of mainstream comedy--bookers for the ""Tonight Show,"" casting directors of big-budget films--had never heard her name. ""Every black comedian in the country knew what I could do,"" she said. ""But that doesn't mean everyone else is paying attention."" Chris Rock, who met Jones when they were both road comics in the late eighties, told me, ""Black women have the hardest gig in show business. You hear Jennifer Lawrence complaining about getting paid less because she's a woman--if she was black, she'd really have something to complain about. ""Jones spent much of her career performing in what she calls ""shitty chitlin-circuit-ass rooms, where you're just hoping the promoter pays you."" She told me that, around 2010, ""I stopped only doing black clubs. I stopped doing what I call 'nigger nights'--the Chocolate Sundays, the Mo' Better Mondays. I knew how to relate to that audience, and I was winning where I was, but I wasn't moving forward."" She lived in Los Angeles at the time, and she began asking for spots at the Comedy Store, where David Letterman and Robin Williams got their starts. A comedian named Erik Marino, who befriended her there, said, ""She felt very strongly that she was being pigeonholed as a black comic--a BET comic. ""For a while, Jones performed at the Store at odd hours. Then, she said, ""I went to the booker and I threw the race card at him. 'Why you won't let me go up at ten on a Friday? 'Cause I'm black?' "" The booker gave her a prime-time slot. ""She destroyed, obviously,"" Marino said. ""Bookers are the ones who care about black rooms versus white rooms. To us comedians, it's, like, if you know what you're doing and you can connect with an audience, they're gonna laugh. ""Rock saw Jones perform at the Store in 2012. After her set, he told her, ""You were always funny, but you're at a new level now. """"You're right,"" she responded. ""But I'm not gonna really make it unless someone like you puts me on."" Rock took out his iPhone and added her name to a list labelled ""Funny people.""</p> <p>Jones has big eyes and a round, rubbery face. She is six feet tall, and often exaggerates her stature by wearing high heels and gelling her hair upward, fright-wig style. ""I know I'm fly--don't get me wrong,"" she told me. ""But I don't look, like, standard Hollywood. As a comedian, it's something you learn to use. ""Some paunchy male comics, such as Louis C. K. and Jim Gaffigan, occasionally refer to their looks; others seem oblivious of their appearance. Women don't have this luxury. Jones often begins her standup sets by ""taking away their bullets""--neutralizing anything that might distract an audience, so that ""they can stop looking at my outfit, stop worrying about whether I think I'm sexy, and just listen."" Her Showtime special, ""Problem Child,"" which aired in 2010, began that way:I know y'all already noticed that I'm a big bitch. . . . When I walk in a Payless, it gets quiet than a motherfucker. . . . I swear, men, if you can get past my big-ass feet and how tall I am, I'm a great fucking catch. . . . I'm fine. I can fuck. I can fight. Oh, I ain't no damsel in distress, motherfucker. You can go get the car, baby, while I handle these three thug motherfuckers.The final line devolves into shadowboxing--Jones bobbing and weaving like a mean-mugging Buster Keaton.One bullet that this opening takes away is speculation about Jones's sexuality. She has never been married and has no children; much of her act these days is about trying to find a man. ""I speak for the lonely bitches,"" she said. She was born in Memphis and raised in a churchgoing family. At one point, she told me, ""It's too bad I'm not gay, 'cause I'd get the flyest bitches. ""The opening of her special also allows her to pivot quickly to pantomime, one of her greatest comedic skills. Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, likes to say that an anchor should be interesting even with the TV on mute. Jones has similar thoughts about comedy. ""People get hung up on writing smart shit,"" she said. ""To me, it's more about performance. Lucille Ball and Moms Mabley, they had face. Before they even said a word, they made you crack up."" Paul Feig, the director of ""Bridesmaids"" and other comedies, compared Jones to Will Ferrell and Chris Farley: ""They all have the ability to take a larger-than-life persona and present it in a real, accessible way. ""Some self-consciously hip venues foster an arch, hyperverbal style of standup that is sometimes called alt comedy. A Jones show is more like a semi-improvised concert. ""She has a presence, when you see her live, that is extremely rare,"" the comedian Marc Maron said. ""And, honestly, it has very little to do with what she's saying. The first time I saw her, I was blown away, and yet I couldn't tell you a single one of her jokes. ""Michael Che, a writer and a performer on ""Saturday Night Live"" who also does standup, told me, ""A black audience--we expect our performers to actually perform. And Leslie comes out of that tradition."" Bernie Mac's first appearance on ""Def Comedy Jam,"" in 1992, became canonical not because of his punch lines but because of a defiant refrain that he directed at the audience: ""I ain't scared of you motherfuckers."" Che continued, ""It's not that Leslie yells and screams and jumps around. It's that she's brutally honest, and she knows how to sell material more convincingly than anyone I can think of. As soon as she walks onstage, you know she's the boss. ""Near the end of her Showtime special, Jones takes a deep breath and wipes her face with a small towel printed with the word ""Leslie."" ""This is my favorite part of the show,"" she says. Then she wades into the audience with a cordless microphone. She crouches over a black woman in the front row who is wearing a shiny headband. ""Is that a goddam antenna?"" Jones says. ""I bet you get all the DirecTV channels."" By this point, Jones is practically lying on top of the woman, whispering directly into her ear (and into the microphone). Nearby, audience members laugh so hard that they fall out of their seats. Comedians have always used personalized insults to establish dominance over a crowd; Jones literally gets in her audience's face.A few rows back, she clambers over several audience members to get to a light-skinned black woman wearing blue contact lenses. ""Yeah, I saw your pretty ass, you fuckin' pretty bitch,"" she says. She asks the woman many variations of the same question: ""Are you sucking dick?"" The woman, unfazed, shakes her head no. ""Do you even like dick?"" Jones asks. Again, the woman shakes her head. ""Wow,"" Jones says, wide-eyed. First, she leans toward the woman. Then she backs away. ""Don't you bitches be trying to flirt with me,"" she says. Under her breath, almost to herself, she adds, ""I'm not going to Hell, Lord, like that. ""Jones surveys her audience before picking targets. She told me, ""I can look into a person's eyes for one second and go, 'Don't fuck with him--that's somebody who won't get over what you're about to say. Talk about that other guy instead.' "" When I saw her perform at Carolines on Broadway, a comedy club near Times Square, she got only ninety seconds into her set before turning to a white man with a vintage vest and sculpted facial hair. ""That goatee is _bull_shit,"" she said. ""And your girl is pissed that you wore that shit."" Pause. ""Her family fuckin' hates you. It's cool to be in New York with your goatee and your vest. In South Dakota, that's some _bullshit! _"" Mocking a goatee is not trenchant observational humor, but Jones's swagger, and the specificity of her language, made the bit feel charged, like a knife trick performed at close range.She ended the set by singling out a young white woman in the audience and contriving a reason to bury her face in the woman's hair--less a joke than a performance of trampled social mores. As the houselights came up, the woman said, with a dazed smile, ""Her sweat is all over me! What just happened?""</p> <p>On the ""Alias Smith and LeRoi"" podcast, which was recorded in late 2013, Jones returned often to the topic of sexism. ""You guys gotta support us,"" she said. ""You have somebody like the dude from 'S. N.L.' say that black women are not funny? People listen to that shit. ""LeRoi corrected her: ""He didn't say 'funny.' He said 'ready.' ""They were referring to a recent TV Guide article noting that ""S.N.L."" had just hired six new cast members, five of them white men. The reporter asked Kenan Thompson, one of two black males on the show, why there hadn't been a black female cast member since 2007, when Maya Rudolph left. ""In auditions, they just never find ones that are ready,"" he said.Soon after the article was published, Thompson was denounced online. (In a reaction video on YouTube, a woman named Dawn Melissa said, ""Seriously, get it together. Because there's no joke funnier than the one your mom made when she had you."") Around this time, Jones was at an L.A. comedy club called Inside Jokes, waiting to go onstage, when someone told her about Thompson's comment. ""He should come battle me,"" Jones said. ""Give me ten minutes and I'll ruin his life."" That night, she had a strong set. After her closing joke, she said, ""And they say we ain't funny, huh?,"" dropped the mike, and walked off to a standing ovation.On the podcast, Jones said of Thompson's remark, ""They're not 'ready'? That's bullshit. 'Cause I know I'm ready. ""LeRoi, who has worked as a producer on several comedy shows, said, "" 'Ready' is not just the can-you-be-on-camera part. When you say 'ready,' it's, like, 'Yeah, bitch, you might have four impersonations, but can you write a fucking sketch? Yes--can you get ten sketches turned down and write an eleventh sketch?' ""She exhaled audibly, but let him finish mansplaining. ""I have never said I would want to be on 'Saturday Night Live,' "" she responded. ""I don't do impressions. I don't know if I could write sketch. So, no, I would never put myself into that circle. Even if they asked me to come and audition, I'd really be, like, 'Eh, I don't know if I can do that.' But I do know women who can."" Pounding a hand on the table, she added, ""There's motherfuckin' three bitches I can call right now, goddammit, that will fill that spot. . . . Just because you don't know them, that don't mean that they don't fucking exist. That's like saying Italy does not exist. Motherfucker, yes, it does. I've been there.""</p> <p>That November, before the podcast with Jones came out, Kerry Washington hosted ""Saturday Night Live."" During the opening sketch, an announcer apologized for ""the number of black women"" Washington was being asked to play, ""both because Ms. Washington is an actress of considerable range and talent and also because 'S. N.L.' does not currently have a black woman in the cast."" It got laughs, but it was a comedic response to a serious problem.Meanwhile, the show was secretly planning auditions for black women. The producers looked at more than a hundred women, most of them associated with the troika of traditional ""S.N.L."" feeder troupes: Second City, in Chicago; the Groundlings, in L.A.; and Upright Citizens Brigade, in New York. Jones was not among them.A dozen women were selected for callback auditions, which took place in December, on the ""S.N.L."" stage, at 30 Rockefeller Center. A few days before the callbacks, Chris Rock had dinner with Lorne Michaels, the creator and executive producer of ""S.N.L."" ""You should look at Leslie Jones,"" Rock said. ""She's the funniest woman I know."" Michaels agreed to give her a chance.An ""S.N.L."" audition is notoriously tough: the studio is dark and cavernous, and the producers sit silently near the back. Jones recalled, ""I got onstage, took the mike out of the stand, and went, 'Nope. Y'all are gonna have to move up to where I can see you.' And Lorne got his ass up and moved. ""She did not attempt impersonations or funny voices; she did her act. She opened with an autobiographical anecdote about being a gangly ten-year-old who longed to be a petite gymnast. ""I wrote it in 1987,"" she told me. ""It's the closest I've come to a perfect joke, but it took years before I was talented enough to perform it."" The joke is an allegory about defying parental and societal expectations, and it includes two cartwheels. I saw her perform it at Carolines three nights in a row, and it earned an applause break every time.After the ""S.N.L."" audition, Jones flew back to L.A. and waited. A week later, she heard the news: the job had gone to Sasheer Zamata, a twenty-seven-year-old improviser and sketch performer at U.C.B., who is Disney-princess pretty. Jones said, ""I understood why they gave it to her--she'd been doing sketch for a long time, she's a natural fit--but at the same time I was fucking pissed."" The next day, she got a call from Michaels, who asked if she would take a job as a writer. ""I went, 'You know I have no fucking idea how to do that, right?' "" Still, she accepted the offer and moved to Harlem. ""I'd spent a while in the real world,"" she told me. ""I'd seen some shit."" Most of the other ""S.N.L."" writers had graduated from elite colleges within the past decade. ""But one thing I learned--they're not racist. They're just white. They don't know certain things."" During her first week on staff, Drake was the host. Some of the writers wanted to do a sketch about ""The Glass Menagerie."" Jones told me, ""Now, I know what it is. I've been to college. But I went, 'People in Compton smoking a joint, they're changing the channel when this comes on. It doesn't matter if Drake is in the sketch. They don't care what a fucking menagerie is. They think it's ""The Glass Menage a Trois."" ' "" The sketch bombed at the dress rehearsal and was cut. ""Leslie is a pretty good litmus test for what America will think is funny,"" Zamata told me.When Jones met Kenan Thompson, she confronted him about his TV Guide interview. ""I came at him, like, 'I heard what you said, motherfucker.' He said, 'Come in, close the door, let's talk.' "" Thompson told me, ""What I said was that the show hadn't found the right people. That was true. And at the end of the day Leslie and Sasheer both got jobs, so I'm happy."" These days, Jones said, ""Kenan is possibly my best friend on the show.""""S.N.L."" often hires good-looking young comics--Chevy Chase, Adam Sandler, Jason Sudeikis--who go on to become leading men in Hollywood. In the eighties, Al Franken, then a producer on the show, recommended a pudgy nebbish named Jon Lovitz. Franken told Michaels, ""He's everything we're not looking for in one person."" Lovitz was hired, and he became a key cast member for five seasons. ""I tell Leslie all the time, 'You're everything we weren't looking for,' "" Michaels said. ""When someone's funny, they're funny. She was fully formed as a standup. I knew she'd have to learn the sketch thing, the technique part, but with some people you go, 'Let's just get them in the building.' "" After a few months, Jones was added to the cast.Rock said, ""I mentioned her to several managers and agents over the years. Everybody passed. Lorne, because he's the best at what he does, is the one who saw it. I don't think he'd hired a cast member her age in a long time."" In fact, Jones was the oldest cast member ""S.N.L."" had ever hired.</p> <p>Despite the name, about a quarter of ""Saturday Night Live"" is pre-taped, usually on the Thursday or Friday before the broadcast. In April, Jones spent a misty Thursday in Bayside, Queens, shooting a ""Game of Thrones""-meets-""Boyz n the Hood"" sketch that required her to ride a horse for the first time. ""I definitely spent the morning in bed with a sore ass,"" she told me. ""I hope people get it. Do kids even know who John Singleton is anymore? ""Late the following night, at 30 Rock, a camera crew filmed a parody movie trailer--a venerable ""S. N.L."" form that allows for a parade of celebrity impressions. Jones was in costume as Missy Elliott, whose song ""Work It"" contains a line of rhythmic nonsense: ""Ra-ta-ta-ta ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta."" Because the parody trailer was about space aliens, Jones was asked to replace the last ""ta"" with ""space."" One of the sketch's writers, Alison Rich, a recent Harvard graduate with blunt-cut bangs, did her best to sell the joke, but Jones gave her a befuddled look. (Later, Colin Jost, an ""S.N.L."" writer and performer, told me, ""When Leslie thinks something is funny, she's extremely generous. When she doesn't think something is funny, you usually know it. "")Jones performed a few takes. She made the line sound better than it was, infusing the word ""space"" with hip-hop bravado, but she used the wrong number of syllables. Rich stopped her and said, ""I think, actually--are there maybe not enough 'ta's? ""Rich, smiling solicitously, played the song on her phone. ""You see how many 'ta's there are?"" she said. ""You gon' kill me on the 'ta's, bitch?"" Jones said, enunciating each word for effect. It could have been the punch line in a standup bit, except that no one seemed to know if she was joking. ""Why am I even listening to a white girl on this?"" she said.Rich's smile dimmed, and she looked around anxiously. The only person to meet her eye was Natasha Rothwell, a black writer, who gave Rich a subtle, reassuring nod. The shooting continued. In the final cut of the sketch, Jones delivered a different lyric from the same song. ""I've perfected the art of busting on people,"" Jones told me later. ""That's how comedians show each other love."" ""Top Five,"" a 2014 comedy written and directed by Chris Rock, features a long, largely ad-libbed scene in which an ensemble of comedians--including Rock, Jones, and Tracy Morgan--trade admiration-tinged insults. ""That was the best scene in the movie, and Leslie was the best part of it,"" Rock said. ""Whenever I showed the movie to other directors--Ben Stiller, P. T. Anderson, Judd Apatow--their first reaction was always pointing at Leslie and going, 'Who is that?' "" Apatow was so impressed that he and Amy Schumer created a part for Jones in ""Trainwreck."" When Schumer's character finds herself on a stopped subway train, she turns to Jones for help. ""Do I look like I work for M.T.A.?"" Jones says, her eyes lighting up with contempt. ""What, I got MetroCards in my fucking purse now? ""Jones's ability to wring laughs from almost nothing--a raised eyebrow, a drawn-out pause--allows her to transmute a screenwriter's B-minus joke into an A. But, in her standup, this gift has an unfortunate consequence: she is so reliably successful with sets that consist of crowd work and time-tested jokes that she feels little pressure to write new material, like a chef who can make a gourmet meal out of whatever happens to be in the fridge. ""As Leslie gets really famous, it'll be harder for her to repeat stuff,"" Rock said. ""Until then, you do what works. ""One night, I had dinner with Jones at Buddakan, an Asian-fusion restaurant in Chelsea that looks like it could serve as a set for ""The King and I."" ""The dan-dan noodles here are fucking insane,"" she said. After dinner, dessert, and a couple of rounds of Patron, we took a cab to the Comedy Cellar, in Greenwich Village. The booker, Estee Adoram, greeted Jones with a hug and implored her to perform, but she preferred to socialize. She walked past the comedian Judah Friedlander--he grabbed her arm and said, ""Keep kicking ass""--and took a seat next to Larry Wilmore. At one point, the reactionary pundit Ann Coulter stopped by their table. Wilmore was courteous, but Jones leaned across the table and stage-whispered, ""What the fuck is this frightening bitch doing here?"" Coulter's face froze in a rictus, and she soon backed away from the table.We then took a taxi to the Comic Strip, on the Upper East Side, where a friend of Jones's was hosting a standup show. On the way, she predicted, ""Either he's gonna make me perform or he's gonna make me smoke weed with him."" The friend, standing outside the club between sets, saw Jones getting out of the cab and immediately started ribbing her: ""I've been texting you. You too famous for me now?"" They slipped away and returned a few minutes later, looking more relaxed. In the lobby, someone gestured at a TV mounted near the ceiling. It was a rerun of ""S.N.L."" Jones was performing on the show's fake-news segment, ""Weekend Update."" Her mouth was an emotional roulette wheel: withering glower, self-assured sneer, toothy smile. The TV was inaudible, and a bartender scrambled for a remote, but people in the lobby were already laughing.</p> <p>One Tuesday night in May, Jones sat in her ""S. N.L."" office, talking on the phone with her accountant. On Tuesday nights, the host walks from office to office, listening as writers and cast members propose ideas for sketches; the most promising proposals become scripts, which are performed at a table read the next day. That week's host, Louis C.K., could be heard across the hall, laughing generously behind a closed door.Jones hung up. ""I have a couple of ideas I might try on Louis,"" she said. ""There's one called 'Jungle Fever,' where he's never had sex with a black girl and she's never had sex with a white guy, and they're asking each other questions. But Kenan said, 'You gotta stop making everything about race, because sometimes it's scary to people.' So I'm figuring out how to rewrite it. ""Jay Pharoah, who became a cast member in 2010, at the age of twenty-three, stopped by Jones's office. ""Remember the guy who tries to steal intangible stuff?"" he said, referring to an old sketch idea."" 'Yo, let me get that confidence off you,' "" Jones said."" 'Let me get your appetite, son. I like the way you be eating things,' "" Pharoah said. ""That's funny, Jay,"" Jones said. ""You should write that, and put me in it. ""Pharoah continued down the hall. ""He's been messing around with that all year, but he never sits down and writes it,"" Jones said. ""I love Jay to death, but he's like a toddler, man. ""Later that night, Pharoah and a writer, Mikey Day, put together a draft of the sketch. It got laughs at the table read, and the producers decided to pre-tape it. So on Friday morning C.K., Pharoah, Jones, and four other cast members gathered at a warehouse in an industrial part of Brooklyn. The sketch was set at a rooftop cookout, and the warehouse's roof was crammed with camera equipment and about fifty extras. Jones, wearing a red wig and hoop earrings, stood behind a grill, flipping burgers. Every few takes, a P.A. collected them and fed them to the crew.Pharoah wore a red Yankees cap and a cornrow wig. ""Yo, lemme get that confident smile off you,"" he said. The other actors, playing his neighbors, rolled their eyes.While the crew reset the cameras, Jones went inside to rest. She was in a bad mood. ""I know this is a good job, but, honestly, it's brutal sometimes,"" she said. She had woken up before five, to get picked up in Harlem and driven to Brooklyn. ""I sometimes wonder what this would have been like if I was in my twenties,"" she said. ""Right now, I can't wait for Sunday, so I can fall the fuck asleep. ""Zamata and Bobby Moynihan, another cast member, napped on leather couches nearby; C.K. and Thompson groggily refilled their coffee cups. Only Pharoah was indefatigable. He stayed on the roof, keeping the extras entertained. (To a white couple: ""Let me get that comfort with being two of the only Caucasians here off you. "")The cast ran through the sketch a few more times. Between takes, C.K. pulled Pharoah and Thompson aside and said, ""My voice in this--I'm not sounding, like, too black, am I? """"Because we're also gonna do the Sprint-store thing,"" C.K. said. In that sketch, he played a cell-phone salesman who switched into exaggerated street slang whenever his boss, played by Jones, was in the room. ""I'm just imagining articles coming out on Sunday morning about me doing racist voices. """"Just be funny, man,"" Thompson said. ""Don't worry about the blog stuff."" This led to a riff about how various iconic comedians would have responded to online scrutiny. (Pharoah, doing a Richard Pryor impression: ""The thing that be botherin' me about Bossip is . . ."") When standups perform, their jokes include exposition, to keep the audience from getting lost; but comedians among their own kind are like chess players executing a quick flurry of moves.Jones, flipping burgers, continued to sulk. Between takes, Pharoah turned to her and said, ""Les, you look like you're about to slice somebody's head off with that spatula. """"Yo, let me get that ability to stay angry in front of all these people that's paying you,"" Pharoah said.C.K. joined in: ""Let me get that unalterable edge of anger impervious to success off you. ""Pharoah and C.K. were, in their way, expressing concern, and Jones seemed appreciative. Nevertheless, she played up her frustration for laughs. ""I've been standing here all day inhaling smoke from this stank-ass grill,"" she said. Pharoah and C.K. smiled, giving her space to keep going. ""I hate the sun on my face,"" she continued. ""I hate this horrible-ass neighborhood."" She peered out over the rooftop, selecting objects for ridicule. ""I hate these dingy-ass auto shops. I hate this nasty graffiti everywhere. Can't even get it together to have some nice graffiti. ""Gradually, she lightened up. In the next take, C.K. slipped into a stilted locution. Jones grinned and said, ""Did someone tell you this was Shakespeare?""</p> <p>Like many standups, Jones generates most of her material in performance, discovering funny phrases and gestures onstage. When she became a writer for ""S. N.L.,"" she barely knew how to use a word-processing program. ""I'm old school,"" she said. ""I wouldn't even buy a cell phone until a few years ago."" Zamata told me, ""I remember sitting in Leslie's office and watching her go, 'How do I get the ideas out of my head and onto the page?' """"My sense was that, before she came here, she wasn't a regular viewer,"" Lorne Michaels said. Jones confirmed this. ""I watched 'S.N.L.' the way most black people watched it: I watched Eddie. Then I stopped. ""During her first few months as a writer, Jones submitted a variety of sketches, most of them adapted from her act, including one in which Lena Dunham played Jesus' personal assistant, and one about the types of women in a night-club posse (the designated driver, the alcoholic, the slut). None made it to air. ""As a comedian, it's, like, 'I'm bombing. What am I doing wrong?' "" she said. ""At least they still paid me. ""It was her first regular paycheck. When Jones was born, her father, an electrical engineer, worked as a studio technician at WDIA, in Memphis, which is often called ""the nation's first all-black radio station."" In 1979, Stevie Wonder bought KJLH, an R. & B. station with offices in Compton, and hired Jones's father. The family moved to Lynwood, which borders Compton to the north.After a while, Jones's father left KJLH and the family moved to a rougher part of Lynwood. ""I remember my brother and them always having to run home from school, so the gangsters wouldn't beat them up,"" Jones said. ""It was easier for me. People would see me walking and be, like, 'You're going straight home, right?' I was a basketball player, and they knew I was serious about success, not getting pregnant. I didn't know what I was gonna be yet, but I knew I was gonna get the fuck out of there."" Crack came to Lynwood in the eighties. ""That fucked everybody up. My brother started selling, and you'd see the most unexpected people coming to the window. The dude I used to have a crush on--he's a crackhead now? My high-school teacher--it got her, too? ""She went to Chapman University, a Christian college in Orange County, on a basketball scholarship. College, she said, was her ""hippie phase"": ""no shoes, no underwear, sex with strange people--good times."" Before her sophomore year, her basketball coach got a job at Colorado State, and Jones transferred there. ""They weren't really my people in Colorado,"" she said. ""A lot of white girls with ponytails."" A friend signed her up for a comedy competition, and Jones won without having prepared an act. ""I went, 'Fuck college, fuck basketball, I'm funny,' and I dropped out. The next week, I was back in California."" She was nineteen.A month later, she was on a bill with Jamie Foxx, who was then a touring comic. ""I was doing jokes about white churches versus black churches, and imitating my uncle's stutter. I was terrible."" The audience booed her off the stage. Then Foxx performed. ""It was, like, a religious feeling, watching him,"" Jones said. ""I had never seen a real comedian before, at least not in person. ""After the show, Foxx took her to a Fatburger. ""You could be good, but you don't have shit to talk about yet,"" he told her. ""You need to get your heart broken, have some bad jobs--live life for a while. ""Jones took this advice so seriously that she did not perform for six years. She worked as a cook, a cashier, and a waitress; she sold perfume at a mall; she became a justice of the peace and officiated at weddings. When she started performing again, in the mid-nineties, she kept working part time; a spot on BET's ""ComicView"" paid only a hundred and fifty dollars. ""I was the funniest waitress Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles ever had,"" she said. ""Customers would be, like, 'Didn't I just see you on BET?' I'd be, like, 'Yep. Breast and a wing or leg and a thigh?' "" She and her long-term boyfriend broke up, which renewed her drive to make money, and also inspired jokes about the single woman's plight. (""I be walking up to men in the club, like, 'Can you lend me some dick till I get on my feet?' "") By her estimation, it took ten years before she found her comedic voice.One night, after a bad date, she came home alone, smoked a joint, and turned on the TV. She told me, ""A slave movie was on and, out of bitterness, this ridiculous idea popped into my head: during slave times, I never would have been single."" She wrote a joke based on the premise, but felt it was too personal to perform. ""It wasn't a commentary on slavery,"" she said. ""It was about my pain--about how hard it is, as a black woman, to get black dudes to date you. The first time I told it""--to a mostly black audience in L.A.--""it massacred to the point where I went, 'There's something real here.' "" She told it several more times, in clubs and on TV.For her first appearance on ""S.N.L.,"" she repeated the joke, almost unchanged, from behind the ""Weekend Update"" desk. ""I do not want to be a slave,"" she said. ""Hell, I don't like working for you white people right now, and y'all pay me. I'm just saying . . . I would be the No. 1 Slave Draft Pick. All of the plantations would want me. I'd be on television, like LeBron, announcing which plantation I was gonna go to. I would be, like, 'I would like to take my talents to South Carolina.' "" The joke sparked outrage online--Jamilah Lemieux, in Ebony, called it ""a grossly offensive skit about slave rape""--but it also demonstrated Jones's obvious talent as a performer. ""Live from New York!,"" a recent documentary about ""S.N.L.,"" devoted several minutes to the joke, the backlash, and the backlash to the backlash, including a comment from Jones: ""Not only did I take something of pain and make it funny, motherfucker--it was brilliant.""</p> <p>The next time Jones appeared on ""Weekend Update,"" four months later, the director Paul Feig was watching at home. ""I don't normally like when actors are big and loud,"" he said. ""But she was able to do it with this grounded, relatable sort of energy. Before her segment was over, I said to my wife, 'I think she's one of our ghostbusters.' ""Feig and I were speaking in a hangarlike space in Norwood, Massachusetts, outside Boston. It was September--the sixty-ninth day of a seventy-two-day shoot. Feig's reboot of ""Ghostbusters,"" to be released next summer, will star Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Jones. In it--unlike in ""Trainwreck""--Jones will play an M. T.A. employee. The movie was still officially untitled, but on-set swag was labelled ""Ghostbusters 2016. ""Most of the on-location filming took place on the streets of Boston, camouflaged as New York. Interior shots were captured in the Norwood building, a former Reebok warehouse, which contained green screens and a handful of lifelike sets: a Chinese restaurant's colorful facade, a two-story Art Deco hotel lobby. Jones's character, Patty Tolan, is a station agent turned--spoiler alert--ghostbuster.The original movie and its sequel featured four ghostbusters, but the substantive roles went to the three white stars--Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Bill Murray. Ernie Hudson, an African-American graduate of the Yale School of Drama, played Winston Zeddemore, the Zeppo of the bunch. Hudson recently wrote in Entertainment Weekly that, when he first read the script, ""It was a bigger part, and Winston was there all the way through the movie."" In the final script, the part had eroded.Feig said that, compared with Winston, ""Patty's a bigger part. I definitely wanted four equal team members."" Jones told me, ""He made it completely equal. It was like a superhero team, where each one has her own skill but can't use it without the others. ""Before casting Jones, Feig, who wears bespoke suits and carries a walking stick, invited her for a drink at the St. Regis Hotel, in New York. ""It was pleasant at first, but sort of formal,"" he said. ""Then I started asking her about standup. All of a sudden, her personality came through."" Feig did standup in the eighties, and it did not surprise him that Jones hadn't ""crossed over"" earlier: ""You get used to seeing that, unfortunately."" Before meeting Feig, Jones had appeared in about a dozen movies, often as an unnamed character (Night Nurse; Boss Lady). Many went straight to video. Her first starring role will be in ""Ghostbusters 2016,"" whose budget is rumored to exceed a hundred and fifty million dollars.I hadn't seen Jones in several weeks, and when I found her in her trailer she greeted me with ""You can tell I lost weight, right?"" She cheerfully humble-bragged about stunts she had been asked to do: ""These motherfuckers don't understand I'm a comedian. They've got me doing all this Van Damme shit."" The previous day, she told me, she had used one of her ""Ghostbusters"" checks to pay off the last of her credit-card loans. For the first time in her adult life, she was debt-free.She texted several times a minute with McKinnon, who had returned to New York the previous night. They knew each other from ""S.N.L.,"" where McKinnon is also a cast member, but their friendship had deepened on the set. ""She had me walking everywhere--all around Boston, looking at old-fashioned doors and shit,"" Jones said. ""I hated it at first, but then I really got into it."" Though McKinnon had a girlfriend, she and Jones referred to each other as ""my movie wife,"" ""my movie husband,"" or simply ""my bitch."" ""I learned a lot from watching her timing,"" Jones said. ""She is a beast. ""When her makeup and hair were in place, Jones walked through the warehouse to a replica of a New York subway station, with working turnstiles and dirt-streaked tile walls. She entered a fake ticket booth and inspected the props on the desk, which included a paperback about the Constitutional Convention. The cover depicted several Founding Fathers in tricornes. ""Paul, does this look like some shit I would read?"" she said. ""Do you see any black people on this cover, Paul? ""Feig chuckled, sat behind a monitor, and called, ""Action!"" Neil Casey, a U.C.B. alumnus who plays the movie's villain, walked up to the booth. ""Leslie, keep it positive at first,"" Feig said. ""That way, he gets crazier and crazier, and you have somewhere to go. """"Cool,"" Jones said. In the next take, she started out with a dimpled smile, which melted away as Casey grew more menacing.Jones, holding up the book, said, ""Actually, I did find a black dude in here. ""They walked across the warehouse to shoot another scene, set at a concert. In a gag reminiscent of one in ""School of Rock,"" Jones's character had attempted to stage-dive, but the crowd had failed to catch her. In this shot, fans helped her to her feet. The line in the script was ""I can't believe you let me fall! """"What is wrong with y'all? Pick my ass up! """"I don't know if that was a race thing or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell.""""Nice. Give me one last one--dealer's choice. """"Oh, you ain't gonna be able to use my dealer's choice,"" Jones said.Action. ""I can't believe you let a bitch fall like that!"" she said to one of the men. ""I was gonna go out with you, too. ""Feig laughed. When Jones was done with all her scenes, he led her toward the middle of the warehouse, where a group formed a circle around her. ""Folks, this is a Boston wrap on the lovely Ms. Leslie Jones,"" he said. Everyone clapped. Someone handed her flowers. Wiig stepped into the circle, hugged Jones, and said, ""You did it, girl!,"" while doing a self-conscious wiggle dance. It all seemed a bit forced, but as Jones walked away from the set I noticed that she was crying.In her trailer, she sat quietly for a moment, waiting for a hairdresser to remove her wig. ""I think I'm scared to leave this place,"" she said. It took a long time to remove the wig--it was glued to her hairline--and we kept talking as the sun went down outside her trailer window. She was in a reflective mood. Though she still has extended family in Memphis, her mother, father, and brother all died within the past few years. ""When death touches you that close, you say to yourself, 'It's time to start liking who the fuck you are,' "" she said. ""I'm not perfect, but I'm starting to get comfortable, like a sweater you want to wear all the time. ""Her head was tilted back in a washbowl, her eyes closed, but her voice still controlled the room. ""I'm glad this whole success thing is happening now,"" she said. ""I can't even imagine a twenty-three-year-old Leslie in this position. They would have kicked me off the set after two days. I would have fucked half the dudes in the crew."" She sat up and wrapped a towel around her head. ""I was a less confident person back then. And damn sure not as funny.""</p>","Yes"

This is something that I always want to do.""</p> <p>Sandeep made a name for himself in the 2016 under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh where he ended up as the second highest wicket-taker with 14 scalps in six innings at an average of 17 and an economy of 4.67.</p> <p>After picking up five wickets in two warm-up games, Sandeep had a decent outing in Nepal's first match against New Zealand, which they won by 32 runs.</p> <p>Their next match against Ireland saw Sandeep create history by becoming only the fifth bowler in history after Jermaine Lawson (West Indies, 2000), Kamrul Islam Rabbi (Bangladesh, 2010), Harry Conway (Australia, 2012) and Kuldeep Yadav (India, 2014), to take a hat-trick in the under-19 World Cup.</p> <p>More than his five-wicket haul, Nepal's eight-wicket win took them to the knockout stages for the second time in their seventh World Cup appearance.</p> <p>""That was my second match for Nepal. The hat-trick against Ireland was a very special moment for me and my people. Adding to that, we qualified for the second round and it was a big achievement for us,"" he said about the match.</p> <p>Nepal's last group game was against India and his team were sent on a leather hunt by opener Rishabh Pant, who scored a 37-ball 78 to help his side win the match by seven wickets with more than 31 overs to spare.</p> <p>Though Sandeep dismissed the Indian captain Ishan Kishan, his figures went for a toss as he conceded 37 runs in 5 overs. What followed though gave Nepal a lot of confidence going into the second match and also the future.</p> <p>Former Indian captain and the coach of the under-19 team Rahul Dravid made a surprise visit to the Nepal dressing room to motivate the youngsters after their forgettable day in the office. The Nepalese youngsters took Dravid's advice seriously and went on to beat the Indian under-19 team last year in the Asia Cup. Though a majority of Dravid's first team players were missing (he asked them to play the Ranji Trophy instead of the Asia Cup), Nepal's victory over India is the biggest achievement in their cricketing history to date.</p> <p>""Rahul Dravid is a legend. It was very good of him to come and talk to us after the game. He just came to us and told us that we all played well. He also acknowledged us and wanted us to keep focusing on the game in the future. He told us about the things we needed to do in order to improve. We just followed it and (sorry to say this) we defeated India in a 2017 Asia Cup match a couple of months back (laughs). Beating the Indian team is the biggest achievement in the history of Nepali cricket,"" he added.</p> <p>With his performance in the 2016 under-19 World Cup, he not only made a name for himself, but also secured him a mentor in the form of former Australian skipper Michael Clarke. Immediately following the tournament, Clarke was informed about Sandeep's talent and the wasted no time in picking the teenager to play alongside him for Kowloon Cantoons in the Hong Kong T20 Blitz.</p> <p>Soon after that, Clarke invited the leggie Down Under to play for his team Western Suburbs in the NSW Premier Cricket season. Since then, Clarke's influence has been enormous in Sandeep's career. Words of encouragements from Clarke, who was a very good player of spin bowling, will only help the 17-year-old in the future.</p> <p>Talking about Clarke, the leggie said, ""He has done a lot of things to me which nobody else has done in my life. I hail from a small country like Nepal where the cricketing culture is different from other countries. Still, he recognised my talent, and gave me an opportunity to train in his academy in Australia. He also helped me get a lot of exposure that helped me play against any side with confidence. He has been a very good guiding light for me and I am grateful to have him on my side. He is a good player of spin bowling and often appreciates my talents. That was a big thing for me. In spite of the good work, he used to ask me to improve further.""</p> <p>One of the biggest positives for Nepal is the support they are getting from their fans. Whenever the South Asian country host a match, people turn up in huge numbers to support their team. The stadium is full and the fans watch the match sitting on trees that are around the ground.</p> <p>Ever since the fans in Nepal got to know of Sandeep's presence in the final list of players for the IPL auction, he has received wishes from all quarters, with many even praying for him to get picked by one of the eight franchises.</p> <p>""Fans back home are really passionate about the sport. Whenever there is a cricket match in Nepal, people turn up in huge numbers and support us. As many as 25000-30000 fans used to come and watch us play, something that motivates us whenever we step on the field. Also, the popularity of the sport in the country is increasing every single day. Even now, a lot of people supported and wished me when they saw my name in the IPL auction (laughs). The fan support has been a blessing in disguise for Nepal Cricket,"" he said about the fans in Nepal.</p> <p>Sandeep registered his name for the 2018 IPL auction that will take place in Bengaluru on January 27 and 28 with a base price of INR 20 lakhs. He was on the initial list of 1122 players and getting into the final list is not easy as the franchises and GC filter a lot of names from the initial list.</p> <p>But, Sandeep somehow made it to the final list as well which means there is at least one of the eight franchises interested in him. He didn't expect to feature in the final list and was jubilant when he heard the news.</p> <p>""I had my fingers crossed when I registered myself for the auction. I was happy when the IPL Governing Council cleared my name for the final list of 578 players. I am thankful to all those who are involved in the process, the GC members, the franchises' think-tanks etc. for showing their faith in me and including my name in the final list. I still have my fingers crossed as the auction is yet to take place. If I get picked, I would like to give my 100% and make my country proud,"" he said.</p> <p>After hearing this news, his mentor Clarke admitted that he would buy him if he was a part of one of the franchises.</p> <p>UPDATED: Sandeep Lamichhane was sold to Delhi Daredevils for 20 lakhs and became the first player from Nepal to be a part of the IPL.</p> <p>Irrespective of whether he gets picked for the auction or not, his next objective will be helping his team qualify for the 2018 ICC World Cup qualifiers in Zimbabwe scheduled to take place later this year.</p> <p>Nepal will play in the ICC World Cricket League (Division Two) alongside Kenya, UAE, Namibia, Canada and Oman and the top two teams will qualify for the 2018 ICC World Cup qualifiers.</p> <p>""We are training every day and everyone is contributing to the team. We are ready to give more than 100% to qualify for the ICC World Cup qualifiers and then the World Cup as this is very important for Nepal Cricket right now,"" he said about the tournament.</p> <p>""Coming from a country like Nepal, it has not been an easy road for me. But, if you work hard, then you can achieve anything. If you do well, you will get exposure playing around the world and that is exactly what has happened to me. I would like to do for my country what Rashid Khan has done for Afghanistan,"" he concluded.</p> <p>Lamichhane is trying to script his own Rashid Khan-like story in which he will carry the hopes of an entire nation on his shoulders as he vows to be the cricketing hero for the young kids in Nepal. The next few days will shape Sandeep's future as an IPL contract will change his career and the landscape of Nepal Cricket forever.</p>","Yes"

Leyla Zana remained imprisoned between 1994 and 2004.</p> <p>Dashni was born in 1986 in the city of Sulaymaniyah, and began working as a presenter in a TV program for young Kurds in the Netherlands called ""No Control"".</p> <p>She, then, released her first album in 2009 which was called ""Hela Hopa"" which was considered a qualitative change in the Kurdish pop music. Although, her singing and dancing style raised many objections across the Kurdish communities, it got very positive reaction by the modern generation. This album opened the doors of the modern art for the Kurdish girls and without restrictions.</p> <p>Dashni also founded an organization called ""The Green Kids"" which was the first organization concerning the situation of children in remote areas. She distributed more than 200 thousand books for them.</p> <p>Unlike a lot of contemporary artists, Dashni never promoted cosmetics through her social media channels. She prefers to promote the beauty of Kurdistan's nature and history.</p> <p>Rihanna was studying law in Aleppo when she joined the women's protection units (better known as YPJ) on the August 22, 2014.</p> <p>Rehana, with her magical smile, attracted the attention of many people after a Saudi blogger spread the rumor that she had died on the October 3, 2014. What made the attention even bigger was the news that not only she was still alive 10 days later, but that she had also actually killed 100 ISIS men. This news was tweeted 5.500 times. ISIS then published an image of a beheaded woman claiming it was Rehana, but her friends confirmed that the story was fake.</p> <p>Rehana, with her unknown fate, and regardless of the validity of all the stories about her, became a symbol of resistance of Kobani women, as she sparked the interest of the international media.</p>","Yes"

Barthez performed brilliantly throughout the season and became a crowd favourite. The fans loved his eccentric behaviour, his taunting dribbles and step-overs past opposing strikers, and most importantly, his remarkable reaction saves.","Very often it was critical saves that kept United from defeat or dropping valuable points, helping United to the 2000–01 FA Premier League title, their third in a row.","<p>Manchester United started the Millennium as defending Premier League champions, and they carried on their unprecedented success in 2000/01 with a seventh title in nine seasons since the competition's inception in 1992. Sir Alex Ferguson's side also became the first team to win three consecutive top-flight crowns since Liverpool in 1983/84.</p> <p>With United winning the league by an 18-point margin last time round, Sir Alex Ferguson's only major addition was FIFA World Cup-winning France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. A number of the Premier League's top sides were busy, though, as a host of clubs looked to challenge United's dominance.</p> <p>The strike pairing of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen moved to Chelsea, but one win from their opening five matches led to the departure of manager Gianluca Vialli, who had won five trophies in two years in charge. He was replaced by fellow Italian Claudio Ranieri, and Hasselbaink went on to win the Barclays Golden Boot with an impressive 23-goal haul as the Blues recovered to finish sixth.</p> <p>Another Italian made the headlines with a sporting gesture that won the 2001 FIFA Fair Play Award. Paolo Di Canio stopped his own side's attack by catching a cross during West Ham United's encounter with Everton as the opposition goalkeeper Paul Gerrard was down injured in December. One week earlier, Ledley King had opened the scoring in Tottenham Hotspur's 3-3 draw at Bradford City in just under 10 seconds, making it the fastest goal in Premier League history.</p> <p>The summer also saw Leeds United sign Mark Viduka, Dominic Matteo and Olivier Dacourt as they prepared for a UEFA Champions League campaign. Liverpool bolstered their squad with Nick Barmby, who joined from Merseyside rivals Everton, and 36-year-old Coventry City midfielder Gary McAllister.</p> <p>Arsenal had finished runners-up in the previous two Premier League seasons, and they moved level on points with second-placed Man Utd when they beat the defending champions 1-0 at Highbury in October. The victory was sealed by a moment of brilliance from Thierry Henry, who flicked up the ball with his back to goal and found the top corner with a volley from outside the penalty area.</p> <p>The surprise Premier League leaders at this stage were Leicester City, who had won the League Cup the previous season. United beat the Foxes in their following match to reach the summit, and a run of eight victories on the spin helped the Red Devils surge clear at the top of the table.</p> <p>United remained top for the rest of the season and a 6-1 thrashing of Arsenal at Old Trafford in February, including a first-half hat-trick for Dwight Yorke, sent Sir Alex Ferguson's team 16 points clear of the Gunners, who were their nearest rivals. They sealed the title in April, before losses in their final three matches reduced their lead to 10 points by the end of the campaign.</p> <p>While United romped to the title, the race for European places was wide open and two sides who enjoyed remarkable runs in European competition met at Elland Road in November. Australian striker Viduka was the star of the show, scoring all four goals as Leeds beat Liverpool 4-3.</p> <p>Despite the win, Leeds dropped to as low as 14th place in January, but the addition of West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand and an incredible run to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League galvanised David O'Leary's side.</p> <p>A win for the Yorkshire side in the reverse fixture at Anfield moved them up to third on 13 April, but McAllister scored a long-range free-kick in the dying moments of Liverpool's 3-2 win at Everton in their next fixture, and the Reds went on to pick up 19 points from the remaining 21 as they sneaked ahead of Leeds to secure the third and final Champions League spot. The Merseysiders' season was rounded off with a unique treble of League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup (now UEFA Europa League) victories.</p> <p>The other unlikely contenders for the European places were newly promoted Ipswich Town, who were in third position until 21 April in an astonishing first season back in the top flight. George Burley guided the Tractor Boys to a final finish of fifth, just three points adrift of third-placed Liverpool, and he won the Barclays Manager of the Season award. Ipswich were also inspired by striker Marcus Stewart, who netted 19 goals in his debut Premier League campaign to fire his side towards a first foray into Europe for 20 years.</p> <p>Manchester City, who had joined Ipswich in promotion from the Championship, were unable to emulate the East Anglian side's success and were consigned to relegation. They were joined by Bradford City and Coventry City, the latter demoted from the Premier League for the first time after a series of great escapes in the 1990s.</p> <p>Although the title and relegation places were wrapped up before the final day, the season still had a thrilling finale as Southampton's Matt Le Tissier scored a brilliant half-volley to clinch a last-gasp 3-2 win against Arsenal in the Saints' final match at their 103-year-old stadium, The Dell. The strike was also Le Tissier's 100th and final goal in the Premier League, cementing his cult-hero status with his only professional club.</p>","Unclear"

But what angers her is that the organization's leaders have not taken a strong enough stand to address the problem.</p> <p>And she puts the onus on Penny, who joined USA Gymnastics in 1999 as its senior vice president. He became president and CEO in April 2005.</p> <p>""Steve Penny has driven this narrative from the beginning that he didn't really take the abuse seriously,"" she said. ""We have emails of other people before us who tried until they were blue in the face to get them to pay attention to this topic.""</p> <p>Now is the time to listen to athletes, she said, and make changes.</p> <p>""You're telling me someone who has been dismissive of these types of abuses should hold the position of the presidency of USA Gymnastics? With our children, I don't think so,"" Moceanu explained. ""I think it's time. We need a change in our culture from the top down. We need to know who knew what, when, and get rid of all the bad characters that didn't do what they were supposed to do.""</p> <p>The leadership at USA Gymnastics has ""a responsibility to their members, to their athletes, and they don't put the athletes first, yet they claim they do,"" she said.</p> <p>USA Gymnastics has issued numerous statements saying the safety of children is its top priority. In response to Moceanu's criticisms, USA Gymnastics also provided a statement Friday from Mary Lou Retton, 1984 Olympic all-around champion and past USA Gymnastics Board member:</p> <p>""Over the years, I have been fortunate to be involved with USA Gymnastics as an athlete, a board member and the mother of four gymnasts. I have seen the dedication, passion and commitment USA Gymnastics has made to its athletes, their well-being and promoting a safe environment where all can thrive, achieve their dreams and grow as individuals,"" Retton said. ""I am proud of the advancements USA Gymnastics has made over the years to promote athlete safety.""</p> <p>Walking into Moceanu's home in an upscale, rural subdivision, there are no immediate signs of her distinguished gymnastics career -- nor that of her husband, Dr. Michael Canales, also an accomplished gymnast who competed for Ohio State University from 1996-1999 and was a member of the 1996 NCAA championship team.</p> <p>Instead, the foyer floor is lined with puzzles their 9-year-old daughter, Carmen, had recently completed. Pictures of the couple, with Carmen and their son, Vincent, 7, line the walls.</p> <p>Their gymnastics memories, including Moceanu's gold medal from the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, are relegated to a bookcase in the basement. The shelves are filled with photographs, books, trophies and other memorabilia from the couple's gymnastics careers.</p> <p>Moceanu said she is able to speak out now because she is no longer dependent on gymnastics for her livelihood. She looks back on her gymnastics career and accomplishments with pride and fondness, for the most part.</p> <p>""It's the greatest sport in the world. It's such a great sport,"" she said. ""It has right now some problems we need to fix. But just like anything in life, we address them. We are responsible. We deal with them. We fire who needs to be fired and we move forward because we cannot continue the same inaction.""</p> <p>""I look at it always as a collection of my hard work,"" she said.</p> <p>It's a reminder of the opportunity and the rewards of hard work that she shares with her children, including Vincent, himself a budding young gymnast. But it's also a reminder that there are right and wrong ways to achieve one's dreams.</p> <p>""I said this is a symbol of excellence and you can get this, too, one day. You can be everything you want to be,"" she explained. ""If you want to be a gymnast and you want to go to the Olympics, you can do it. But we're going to be by your side and you're going to do it healthy.""</p> <p>Call IndyStar reporter Tim Evans at (317) 444-6204.
